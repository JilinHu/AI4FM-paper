#### Background
- **Background**
The paper introduces recent efforts in AI agency, focusing on agents interacting with the environment through programming, command-line, and web browsing to undertake complex tasks.
  
- **Existing Work**
Existing works present limitations in addressing software development challenges for AI agents, such as enabling effective code creation/modification, providing real-time information gathering tools, and ensuring safe development that avoids negative impacts on user systems.
  
#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced OpenDevin, a community-driven platform**
  - **Challenge 1: How to implement a mechanism allowing AI agents to interact with the world through software intricately?**
    OpenDevin offers a robust and flexible interaction mechanism through an event stream architecture, facilitating interactions between user interfaces, agents, and environments.

  - **Challenge 2: How to establish an environment that is safe and allows agents to perform their tasks?**
    OpenDevin encompasses an environment consisting of a sandboxed operating system and a web browser that agents can utilize for task execution.

  - **Challenge 3: How to evaluate agent performance and coordinate multiple agents working together?**
    OpenDevin includes an evaluation framework that permits assessment across various tasks and supports collaboration among several specialized agents.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The platform currently has implemented over 10 agents, including a potent generalist agent based on the CodeAct architecture, enhanced with capabilities for web browsing and code editing. Agents interact with users via a chat-based user interface that visualizes current agent actions and permits real-time feedback. Using 15 benchmarks, including software engineering (e.g., SWE-BENCH) and web browsing (e.g., WEBARENA), the agents are evaluated. OpenDevin has gained significant traction with 28K GitHub stars and contributions from over 160 contributors amounting to more than 1.3K.

#### Summary
OpenDevin is a community-driven platform tailored for developing generalist and specialist AI agents that interact with the world through software, featuring a dynamic interaction mechanism, a sandboxed operating system and web browser environment, and a comprehensive evaluation framework.
