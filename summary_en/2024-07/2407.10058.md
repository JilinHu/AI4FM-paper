#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in processing and generating natural language, with a focus on the significant privacy risks posed by their potential inadvertent memorization of private information.

- **Existing Work**
Existing efforts have leveraged Machine Unlearning (MU) as a means to tackle privacy issues, aiming to remove undesirable data's influence and the associated model capabilities without retraining the model. However, there is a lack of assessment of MU methods in real-world scenarios, where the individuals are actually in existence and have been memorized by the LLMs.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introducing the RETURN dataset**
  - **Challenge 1: Real-world Personal Data Protection**
    There is currently no dataset available for evaluating MU methods for protecting individuals' data in scenarios that consider the memorization aspect of models. RETURN is a dataset comprising 2,492 individuals from Wikipedia and associated QA pairs for evaluating MU methods in protecting personal data in realistic scenarios.

  - **Challenge 2: Distinguishing the Forget Set from the Retain Set**
    Existing MU methods are often sensitive to hyperparameter selections or ineffective at discriminating between forget and retain sets. To address these drawbacks, the paper proposes a novel unlearning method called Name-Aware Unlearning Framework (NAUF) for privacy protection, comprised of two main components: Name-Aware Refusal Answer and Contrastive Data Augmentation. The former aids the model in learning which individuals' information to protect, while the latter broadens both the forget and retain set distributions to enhance our method's generalization.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments conducted on the RETURN dataset showed NAUF's efficacy; it achieved a world-best average unlearning score, surpassing the best baseline method by 5.65 points, proving its effectiveness in protecting targeted individuals' personal data while preserving the modelâ€™s capabilities for dealing with other unrelated individuals' information.

#### Summary
The paper introduces a novel machine unlearning framework, NAUF, and the accompanying real-world personal data unlearning dataset, RETURN, to evaluate and improve LLMs' performance in privacy protection.
