#### Background
- **Background**
QAEA-DR is a framework that exploits Question-Answer Generation (QAG) and Event Extraction (EE) for enhancing text in dense retrieval scenarios. It utilizes LLM prompting to generate two types of text representations: QA pairs and event-driven elements.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work in the domain of information extraction and question-answer generation faces challenges related to multilingual support, controllable generation quantity and quality, and integration within a unified framework. Present data augmentation methods fail to enhance the original text in text retrieval; hence, this paper presents the text augmentation framework for addressing this gap.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced QAEA-DR**
      - **Challenge 1: How to enhance original text in text retrieval**
The current data augmentation methods in text retrieval focus on cross-modal retrieval and do not address enhancing the original text. QAEA-DR overcomes this challenge by generating high-quality and controllable text outputs and integrating QAG and EE into a unified framework for text generation and organization.
  
  - **Challenge 2: Compatibility of the preprocessing module for improving retrieval performance with various embedding models**
QAEA-DR not only functions as a preprocessing module to enhance retrieval performance but also shows compatibility with a range of embedding models (such as Sentence-BERT, DPR, Contriever, BGE), making it widely applicable across diverse retrieval settings.

#### Implementation and Deployment
QAEA-DR is an innovative and universal text augmentation framework linking event extraction and question-answer generation into a coherent framework for text generation and organization. It leverages an LLM-based, training-free text generator with diverse prompts and scoring-based output evaluation to produce high-quality, controllable text outputs. Its effectiveness and robustness are demonstrated through theoretical analysis and empirical validations across various embedding models and retrieval datasets, showcasing the extensive improvement in retrieval performance when event vectors and QA pair vectors are included in the vector database.

#### Summary
The QAEA-DR framework introduces innovative text enhancement techniques for dense retrieval by integrating event extraction and question-answer generation, thereby improving text generation quality and robustness, with compatibility across multiple embedding models as proven in experimental validations.
