#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses that as online content has dramatically increased, recommendation systems have become key to managing information overload. However, current recommendation algorithms often overlook direct user input, resulting in superficial human-computer interaction. Some systems have attempted to include the user directly in the recommendation process via conversation, but these too have been limited in interactivity.

- **Existing Work**
Current recommendation systems are not capable of learning directly from user feedback. Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have become popular for their ease of use and responsive capabilities to feedback, the study of them as conversational recommenders is still quite limited.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a ChatGPT-based conversational recommendation system**
      - **Challenge 1: How to effectively employ ChatGPT's conversational ability for recommendations**
        The paper developed a rigorous process around ChatGPT to simulate how a user might realistically probe the model for recommendations: first by instructing and then re-prompting with feedback to refine a set of recommendations.
  
      - **Challenge 2: Understanding and mitigating popularity bias in ChatGPT's recommendations**
        The study found that re-prompting ChatGPT with feedback is an effective way to improve recommendation relevancy, and popularity bias can be mitigated through prompt engineering.
#### Implementation and Deployment
The process proposed by the paper is designed to not only evaluate the recommendation ability of ChatGPT using conversation but also to refine a set of recommendations for a user in practice. This process includes a prompt engineering approach that utilizes iterative feedback and experiments assessing ChatGPT as a Top-n recommender. By comparing with baseline models, it was found that re-prompting ChatGPT with user feedback effectively enhances the relevancy of recommendations. Additionally, the paper studied the popularity bias in ChatGPT recommendations and proposed possible mitigation strategies.

#### Summary
This paper explores the efficacy of ChatGPT as a conversational recommendation system. It develops a process around ChatGPT that simulates real-user scenarios and addresses and mitigates popularity bias.
