#### Background
- **Background**
Clinical question summarization is critical in healthcare to enhance doctor-patient interactions and medical decision-making. Although there's plenty of textual research, the integration of visual cues along with text has been largely overlooked. This work introduces a multimodal approach for summarizing mixed Hindi-English clinical questions in resource-constrained settings.

- **Existing Work**
Existing works have not leveraged the opportunity to combine textual information with visual data, such as images, which plays a crucial role in medical question summarization (MQS). Furthermore, using LLMs and VLMs for summarizing multi-modal and code-mixed queries is an area that has been relatively unexplored due to complexity in medical images and potential gaps in contextual understanding which can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant summaries.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced MedSumm Framework**
  - **Challenge 1: Integrating Visual Information for Summarization**
    MedSumm leverages LLMs and VLMs capabilities to integrate text with images, addressing the gap where existing works overlook visual cues. Using the MMCQS dataset, this work demonstrates the improvement in creating medically detailed summaries by including visual information from images.

  - **Challenge 2: Handling Multimodal and Code-Mixed Inputs**
    The ability of the MedSumm framework to tackle this challenge is due to its unique components: generating textual embeddings using pre-trained large language models, encoding visual information with vision encoders like ViT, employing QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning, and using a precise inference process to generate the respective symptom name and synopsis.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The detailed experimental results and comparisons with related work are not quoted here due to limitations in the response length. For specific information about the actual performance of the MedSumm framework, it is recommended to refer to the experiments section of the original paper to understand its experimental setup, evaluation metrics (like MMFCM), and compare it with other existing works.

#### Summary
MedSumm presents a novel approach for multimodal medical question summarization, integrating textual and visual information to create medically detailed summaries potentially enhancing the quality of healthcare decision-making and deepening the understanding of patient queries.
