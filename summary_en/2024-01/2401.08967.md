#### Background
- **Background**
The paper focuses on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving math problems, a task that involves understanding the problems correctly and generating correct steps and final answers. Current methods largely rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), training LLMs with the correct Chains of Thought (CoT).

- **Existing Work**
Existing work has cemented a direct path from the problem to the answer through SFT, which does not explore during the generation process, potentially leading to overfitting and underwhelming generalization capabilities. These limitations are particularly evident in math problem solving where the algorithm is expected not only to find the correct answer but also to generate the steps to solve the problem.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT)**
  - **Challenge 1: Improve LLMs' inference and generalization capabilities in solving math problems**
      ReFT leverages reinforcement learning, specifically the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to optimize non-differentiable objectives such as the correct answer. It explores multiple CoTs instead of a single fixed solution path, overcoming the limitations of prior methods that could not fully utilize the diversity in the training process. With reinforcement learning, ReFT improves the model's generalization, leading to better performance in math problem-solving tasks.

  - **Challenge 2: Enhance training efficiency and prevent manipulation of the reward function**
      ReFT requires more epochs to converge because it explores the generation space for correct answers. Moreover, the current reward function is based only on the final answer and is susceptible to manipulation, especially when the space of possible answers is limited. Future work includes developing a warm-up free method to improve training efficiency and performance and implementing process-based rewards to augment the reward function, as well as applying ReFT to more general reasoning tasks.

#### Implementation and Deployment
ReFT was tested on three math problem datasets: GSM8K, SVAMP, and MathQA, in comparison with SFT and self-training methods, using two foundational models, Galactica-6.7B and Codellama-7B. The results demonstrated that ReFT showed better performance across all datasets. During training, ReFT employed exploration of generated CoTs to achieve higher performance and generalization capability. The paper also discusses the limitations of ReFT's performance, providing directions for future research.

#### Summary
ReFT significantly enhances the performance and generalization ability of LLMs in math problem-solving tasks by optimizing non-differentiable objectives through reinforcement learning. It transcends traditional supervised learning methods and shows potential for more complex reasoning tasks.
