#### Background
- **Background**
With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the field is heading towards an important phase of realizing artificial general intelligence (AGI). AI has evolved from rule-based algorithms to adopting advanced learning models, marking a substantial shift in computing technology. Current AI requires more sophisticated methods to deal with the growth and complexity of data. Systems like Google Gemini and OpenAI Q* emphasize the integration of human insights into AI decision-making, highlighting the importance of human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems. However, HITL systems exhibit limitations in adaptability and real-time responsiveness due to reliance on human input, which can be limited, unpredictable, and erroneous.
- **Existing Work**
HITL systems are limited in handling dynamic and complex environments due to their dependence on human inputs. To effectively develop AGI and overcome these limitations, interactive AI (IAI) has been proposed. The key difference between IAI and HITL is in their interaction modes, with IAI focusing on immediate and direct interactions between AI and users, whereas HITL involves human participation and supervision in the AI decision-making process.

#### Core Contributions
- **Proposed an IAI-enabled network management and optimization framework**
  - **Challenge 1: Integration of IAI to enhance network functionality and user experience**
      IAI interacts directly with users, immediately understanding commands and responding intelligently, thereby enhancing user experience and the effectiveness of AI applications in dynamic environments. With the integration of technologies like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LangChain, IAI can extract information from large databases to enrich responses and decisions, providing more personalized network operations for users.
  - **Challenge 2: Building knowledge base and contextual memory for network optimization using IAI**
      The research team designed pluggable LLM and RAG modules to construct the knowledge base and contextual memory needed for decision-making. These modules enable dynamic network resource allocation and have been validated for their effectiveness through real network optimization case studies.
  
#### Implementation and Deployment
The proposed IAI framework incorporates LLM and RAG to achieve resource optimization and improved network performance in dynamic settings. Effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations based on real network optimization case studies. IAI's direct user interaction and flexibility allow for adaptation to different network scenarios and user requirements, enhancing the systems' versatility and satisfaction.

#### Summary
This paper explores the integration of interactive AI (IAI) with next-generation networking, using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLM) to enhance decision-making capabilities, proved through real network optimization case studies.
