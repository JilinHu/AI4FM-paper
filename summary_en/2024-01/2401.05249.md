#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the quality assessment of arguments in everyday language communication, focusing on the assessment of argument sufficiency (i.e., whether premises sufficiently support conclusions). It highlights the issues with existing methods, such as vague criteria and subjectivity, which impede the accurate training of classifiers.

- **Existing Work**
Existing works primarily rely on human annotations to train classifiers for assessing the sufficiency of arguments. However, the subjectivity and inconsistencies in human annotations make it challenging to develop effective models for sufficiency assessment.

#### Core Contributions
- **A Causality-driven Argument Sufficiency Assessment framework (CASA) for zero-shot scenarios**
  - **Challenge 1: Quantifying argument sufficiency without observational data**
      The framework leverages the common sense and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate contexts inconsistent with the premises and conclusion, then revises them by injecting the premise event to quantify argument sufficiency.

  - **Challenge 2: Intervening in arguments without observational data**
      CASA addresses the challenge by asking LLMs to revise contexts that do not fit premises and conclusions, allowing for the intervention assessment of arguments even without observational data.

#### Implementation and Deployment
CASA was evaluated on two logical fallacy detection datasets, demonstrating its capability to accurately identify insufficient arguments. Compared to baseline methods that include zero-shot prompting and perplexity classification, CASA was more accurate in distinguishing between sufficient and insufficient arguments, recording an average of 10% improvement. Additionally, CASA was deployed in a writing assistance application to generate suggestions that enhance the sufficiency of student-written arguments. Human evaluations showed that the objections generated by CASA were rational and helpful in improving the sufficiency of the arguments.

#### Summary
This paper introduces a zero-shot Causality-driven Argument Sufficiency Assessment framework (CASA) based on LLMs, which effectively tackles challenges in quantifying and intervening in argument sufficiency without observational data and demonstrates its effectiveness in practical applications.
