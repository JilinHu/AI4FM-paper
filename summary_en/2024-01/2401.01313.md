#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the problem of "hallucination" in Large Language Models (LLMs), where models generate seemingly factual content that is unfounded, posing a significant hurdle for the safe deployment of powerful LLMs in real-world production systems, especially in sensitive areas such as medical record summarizations, customer support conversations, financial analysis reports, and legal advice. The article emphasizes that the widespread adoption of LLMs heavily depends on addressing and mitigating hallucinations.

- **Existing Work**
Existing works have not effectively solved the problem of hallucinations in the generative tasks of LLMs. While there have been developments to mitigate this issue, there is a lack of a systematic summary and classification to better understand, compare, and develop techniques for hallucination mitigation.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a comprehensive survey**
    - **Challenge 1: Lack of systematic survey of hallucination mitigation techniques**
        The authors presented an overview of over thirty-two techniques aimed at reducing hallucinations in LLMs and introduced a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps to differentiate the diverse approaches designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs.

    - **Challenge 2: Evaluation and verification of techniques**
        The paper outlined multiple feedback and reasoning techniques, and how they reduce the occurrence of hallucinations by validating and refining the output through feedback mechanisms, including Prompting GPT-3, ChatProtect, Self-Reflection Methodology, Structured Comparative reasoning, etc., emphasizing the practical effectiveness of these techniques in reducing hallucinations in LLMs.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper showcased comprehensive comparisons of experimental results, both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrating how feedback mechanisms for validating and refining answers can reduce hallucinations and provided evidence of the effectiveness of these methods. For instance, the CoVe method reduces hallucinations in tasks like list-based Wikidata questions and long-form text generation. The Mind's Mirror method, by transferring the self-evaluation capability from LLMs to SLMs, improved precision and reliability.

#### Summary
This paper offers an exhaustive survey on hallucination mitigation techniques in LLMs, proposing a categorization framework and systematic feedback and reasoning methods, and assesses the efficacy and impact of these techniques.
