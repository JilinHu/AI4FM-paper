#### Background
- **Background**
    The paper discusses the challenges Large Language Models (LLMs) might face in performing code vulnerability analysis tasks. Current systems are not efficiently solving the in-depth content enhancement and reasoning capabilities for code vulnerability detection because they have not fully utilized knowledge retrieval, tool invocation, prompt schemes, and instruction following.

- **Existing Work**
    Previous attempts to address code vulnerability identification based on LLMs have often not involved capabilities such as knowledge retrieval and external tool invocation, limiting the modelâ€™s understanding and resolution capabilities for complex problems.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introducing a framework named LLM4Vuln**
    - **Challenge 1: How to enhance the model's knowledge retrieval capabilities?**
        LLM4Vuln addresses this by building a searchable vector database of vulnerability knowledge, incorporating not just raw vulnerability reports but also summaries and functional descriptions of each vulnerability. This allows relevant knowledge to be retrieved based on the functional similarity between summaries, thereby increasing retrieval effectiveness and precision.

    - **Challenge 2: How to enhance the model's vulnerability reasoning capabilities through tool invocation?**
        The framework introduces the capability to enhance LLM-based vulnerability analysis by allowing LLMs to invoke external tools, providing context through program analysis that can be extended to include more complex information such as control and data flows.

    - **Challenge 3: How should prompt schemes be designed to improve model execution capability?**
        LLM4Vuln adopts common prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and customizes them for vulnerability analysis scenarios, leading to more accurate and stable LLM performance in vulnerability identification.

    - **Challenge 4: How to improve the output structuration capabilities of models with deficient instruction-following abilities?**
        The authors suggest using a highly instructed model to align and structure the output of a less-instructed model to facilitate automatic result evaluation.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper implemented LLM4Vuln and used it for "training" on 1013 high-quality vulnerability data of smart contracts and ground-truth testing using 75 vulnerability-inducing code segments. It covered 4950 scenarios including three types of knowledge enhancement, two context supplementation options, and three prompt schemes, using three representative LLMs (GPT-4, Mixtral, and Code Llama). By analyzing the results annotated by LLMs, researchers identified ten key findings, revealing the effects of knowledge enhancement, context supplementation, and prompting schemes on LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities. For example, adding vulnerability knowledge helps LLMs' vulnerability reasoning, and shorter summarized knowledge is more effective in improving vulnerability identification accuracy than full reports. Additionally, the framework has been successfully applied to real projects, submitting several issues that were confirmed and awarded bounties.

#### Summary
LLM4Vuln is an innovative framework that significantly enhances LLMs' performance in code vulnerability analysis by providing a vector database of vulnerability knowledge, tool invocation capabilities, custom CoT prompt schemes, and structuring outputs using instructionally proficient models.
