#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the misalignment of modalities between code snippets and natural language queries and the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation tasks. Although LLMs are capable of generating functionally accurate code, the generated code often displays a significant stylistic deviation from the actual code in the codebase.
- **Existing Work**
Previous research has used Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) methods that attempt to improve code search results by adding exemplar codes. However, this method has not significantly enhanced the efficiency of code search, mainly due to the stark stylistic difference between exemplar code and true code. Likewise, existing metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE are not quite fit for measuring the style difference between two codes as they don't consider the syntax and programming conventions.
#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a simple yet effective framework called ReCo**
  - **Challenge 1: How to address the mismatch between natural language queries and code style.**
      ReCo firstly uses LLMs to generate exemplar codes based on queries and then rewrites code in the codebase to achieve style normalization. This process includes summarizing the code into a natural language description, then regenerating the rewritten code that aligns with the style of the exemplar code.
  - **Challenge 2: How to quantify the similarity in code style.**
      ReCo introduces a new metric called Code Style Similarity (CSSim), which is the first metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarities between two pieces of code from a stylistic perspective. CSSim evaluates code style from three aspects: variable naming, API invocation, and code structure, combined with Edit Distance as a softer measurement method.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper evaluates the efficiency of ReCo across various programming languages and search scenarios, including datasets like StackOverflow, CoNaLa, APPS, MBPP, and MBJP. It uses the widely adopted Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) as the evaluation metric and shows that ReCo significantly improves retrieval accuracy on several models (including BM25, CodeBERT, and UniXcoder), especially under zero-shot settings. ReCo also proves effective for retrieval models not specifically trained for code-related tasks.

#### Summary
ReCo significantly enhances code search accuracy by utilizing LLMs to rewrite code in the codebase through style normalization and introduces a new metric, CSSim, to quantify stylistic differences, advancing research in code style normalization.
