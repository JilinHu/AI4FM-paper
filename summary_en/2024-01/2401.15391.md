#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the promising role of large language models (LLMs) in applications such as intelligent chatbots, highlighting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a means to optimize LLM outputs by referencing external knowledge bases. However, existing RAG systems are found inadequate for multi-hop queries that necessitate retrieving and reasoning across multiple evidence pieces.

- **Existing Work**
Existing benchmarks for RAG, like RGB and RECALL, focus on simple cases of retrieving and solving queries with single evidence pieces, failing to assess LLMs' retrieval and reasoning for complex multi-hop queries.

#### Core Contributions
- **Developed a new dataset named MultiHop-RAG**
  - **Challenge 1: Insufficiency of RAG systems for multi-hop queries**
    Existing RAG methods are unsatisfying when it comes to retrieving and answering multi-hop queries that require support from various evidences. The paper addresses this by creating a novel dataset aimed at advancing RAG systems' benchmarking and development in this aspect.

  - **Challenge 2: Lack of a benchmark dataset for multi-hop queries**
    There were no dedicated benchmarking datasets for RAG focusing specifically on multi-hop queries. With the development of the MultiHop-RAG dataset, the researchers fill this gap by providing a resource that includes a knowledge base constructed from news articles, a large set of multi-hop queries with their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper demonstrates the utility of MultiHop-RAG as a benchmark through two experiments. The first experiment compares the performance of various embedding models in retrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. The second experiment assesses the reasoning and answering capacities of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, on multi-hop queries with provided evidence. Results indicate the inadequacy of current RAG implementations in effectively retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. The researchers make the challenging MultiHop-RAG dataset publicly available, hoping it to serve as a valuable resource for the community to develop and benchmark RAG systems, hence tapping into the vast potential of generative AI in practice.

#### Summary
The paper developed the MultiHop-RAG dataset to assess and improve the existing limitations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in handling multi-hop queries requiring retrieval and reasoning. It also provided experimental results demonstrating current RAG systems' limitations on such tasks and released the dataset to encourage further research and development.
