#### Background
- **Background**
LLM-based agents have emerged as popular concepts with the belief that these agents could serve as a model for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Data analysis is recognized as a challenging yet practically significant task for LLM-based agents, necessitating their capability to harmonize natural language and code.

- **Existing Work**
While there have been various developments in LLM-based agents like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and AgentGPT, and applications in data analysis such as OpenAI's Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate agents in the data analysis realm is still absent.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced InfiAgent-DABench**
    - **Challenge 1: General and automated evaluation for data analysis tasks**
      They introduced "DAEval," a dataset comprising 311 data analysis questions derived from 55 CSV files across various domains. The benchmark employs format-prompting techniques to ensure questions are closed-form for automated evaluation.

    - **Challenge 2: Developing an effective agent framework**
      InfiAgent-DABench consists not only of an evaluation dataset but also establishes an agent framework where LLMs can work as agents to reason, interact with files, and invoke tools like a Python sandbox for streamlined assessment.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper meticulously outlines the development of the DABench benchmark, from the collection of real-world CSV files to generating corresponding questions and ensuring the quality of questions through human assessment. Furthermore, in creating the LLM agent framework, a Docker-based local Python code sandbox was developed to allow the secure execution of code in isolation. Additionally, the paper includes the categorization of question difficulty and employs an instruction-tuning dataset on "DAAgent," a specialized agent trained for data analysis.

#### Summary
InfiAgent-DABench offers a novel benchmarking tool that not only aids in measuring the performance of intelligent agents in data analysis tasks but also represents an essential step in exploring how to improve and optimize the application of LLMs in this specific domain.
