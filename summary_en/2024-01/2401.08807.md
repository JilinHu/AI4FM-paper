#### Background
- **Background**
The paper introduces the importance of formal program specifications in the software development process, particularly in stages including requirement analysis, software testing, and verification. However, manual crafting of formal specifications is challenging, consequently making it a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. The current automatic generation methods rely on predefined templates or grammar, which struggle to describe the behavior and functionality of complex real-world programs accurately.

- **Existing Work**
The existing approaches are limited by the predefined templates and grammar rules that they heavily rely on, which often leads to overly simplified specifications that do not capture the actual behaviors of programs adequately.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a new technique named SpecGen**
      - **Challenge 1: How to generate specifications accurately**
SpecGen utilizes the code comprehension abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide the generation of appropriate specifications through a conversational approach. When LLM fails to generate correct specifications, SpecGen employs four mutation operators to modify the model-generated specifications and selects verifiable specifications through a novel heuristic selection strategy.

      - **Challenge 2: Improving the efficiency of specification generation**
SpecGen proposes a mutation-based generation approach to enrich the diversity of LLM output, including a set of mutation operators and a new heuristic selection strategy to improve the efficiency of verification.
      
#### Implementation and Deployment
Experimental results show that SpecGen succeeded in generating verifiable specifications for 100 out of 120 programs, outperforming existing purely LLM-based approaches and conventional specification generation tools like Houdini and Daikon. Further investigations into the quality of generated specifications demonstrated that SpecGen could articulate the behaviors of the input program comprehensively. Additionally, a user study evaluated the semantic quality of the generated specifications, proving SpecGen's ability to accurately and comprehensively characterize program behaviors.

#### Summary
The paper presents SpecGen, an automated formal program specification generation technique that combines Large Language Models with a heuristic selection strategy. By comparison with existing tools and purely LLM-based methods, SpecGen showcases superior efficiency and accuracy in specification generation and offers a dataset to facilitate future research.
