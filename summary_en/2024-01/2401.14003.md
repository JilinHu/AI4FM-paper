#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the challenges LLMs face in reasoning over Commonsense Knowledge Bases (CSKB), particularly their difficulties in acquiring explicit relational constraints from in-context exemplars due to a lack of symbolic reasoning capabilities.

- **Existing Work**
Despite advancements in LLMs' performance in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle in CSKB reasoning. Previous attempts have not been able to overcome LLMs' limitations in acquiring explicit relational constraints from in-context examples, leading to failures in CSKB reasoning tasks.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a plugin tool named ConstraintChecker**
  - **Challenge 1: How to address the limitations of LLMs in CSKB reasoning?**
       ConstraintChecker helps LLMs overcome the deficiency in reasoning by introducing a rule-based module to produce a list of constraints, and a zero-shot learning module to check if the knowledge instance meets all the constraints.

  - **Challenge 2: How to validate the effectiveness of ConstraintChecker?**
       The effectiveness of ConstraintChecker was validated through extensive experiments on two CSKB reasoning benchmarks (CKBPv2 and SD-ATOMIC20), demonstrating significant improvements in LLM performance across multiple metrics and achieving superior results compared to other advanced prompting techniques.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The implementation of ConstraintChecker plugin shows improvements over prompting techniques on two CSKB reasoning benchmarks, CKBPv2 and SD-ATOMIC20, with extensive experiments conducted on two large language models, ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0301) and GPT3.5 (text-davinci-003). It significantly enhanced performance across various metrics, achieving the best results on both benchmarks.

#### Summary
ConstraintChecker is an independent plugin tool that effectively enhances the performance of LLMs in CSKB reasoning tasks. It helps LLMs to perform better in reasoning by providing and checking explicit constraints and has shown to outperform other advanced prompting techniques in validated metrics.
