#### Background
- **Background**
Despite the increasing utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, assessing their performance reliably continues to be a challenge due to the requirement of extensive human annotation and the limited scope of existing benchmarks.

- **Existing Work**
Previous methods involved using LLMs to evaluate other LLMs' outputs, which often demanded meticulous human-annotated datasets that were costly to create, making it impractical for new tasks and scenarios. This led to the use of LLMs as evaluators without proper vetting, resulting in potentially unreliable evaluations.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a scalable meta-evaluation framework SCALEEVAL**
  - **Challenge 1: Costly human annotation**
    SCALEEVAL utilizes a debate between multiple LLM agents, followed by minimal human oversight when there's no LLM agent consensus. This framework allows users to employ their own prompts and responses, adding flexibility and adaptability for various evaluation contexts.
  
  - **Challenge 2: Trustworthiness and efficiency of LLMs as evaluators**
    The study demonstrated that their approach correlates well with human-expert-annotated meta-evaluation. They also assessed the reliability and cost-performance trade-offs of LLMs as evaluators under different scenarios and examined their specific capabilities and limitations.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experiments showed that the SCALEEVAL framework correlates well with entirely human-annotated meta-evaluation. The reliability and cost-efficiency of different LLMs as evaluators were assessed across various scenarios, noting their capabilities and limitations. SCALEEVAL was used to compare with other evaluation strategies like LLM-as-a-Judge, FairEval, and ChatEval, demonstrating its advantages in customization and scalability compared to these methods.

#### Summary
SCALEEVAL is an innovative meta-evaluation framework designed to evaluate the trustworthiness and efficiency of LLMs as evaluators. It incorporates multi-agent LLM debate and minimal human supervision into the evaluation process, providing flexibility and scalability, with experimental results showing high consistency with purely human evaluations.
