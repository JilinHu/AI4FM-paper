#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the importance of Short Text Classification (STC) for processing and understanding the brief yet significant content found on modern digital platforms and points out the difficulties that STC faces in capturing semantic and syntactic details, which is especially evident in traditional pre-trained language models (PLMs). Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) improve performance by integrating external knowledge bases, their effectiveness is limited by the quality and extent of the knowledge used.

- **Existing Work**  
Large Language Models (LLMs) and the emergence of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have markedly improved the performance of complex reasoning tasks. However, some studies have pointed out limitations in using LLMs for foundational NLP tasks. Existing approaches struggle to utilize LLMs for STC tasks and to combine CoT to address the challenges in STC.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced Quartet Logic: A Four-Step Reasoning (QLFR) framework**
  - **Challenge 1: How to utilize the inherent knowledge and capabilities of LLMs to solve STC challenges**
      The QLFR framework decomposes the STC task into four discrete steps: essential concept identification, common-sense knowledge retrieval, text rewriting, and classification, thereby addressing issues of semantic sparsity and syntactic ambiguity by leveraging the potential of LLMs.

  - **Challenge 2: How to enhance the performance of smaller models**
      Developed a CoT-Driven Multi-task learning (QLFR-CML) method to facilitate the knowledge transfer from LLMs to smaller models. This method is both suitable for resource-limited contexts and practical.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments were conducted on six short-text benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The QLFR framework achieved state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, notably on the Ohsumed and TagMyNews datasets with significant improvements. These results demonstrate that the QLFR framework is capable of significantly leveraging LLMs for this challenging task and is superior to several novel baselines. The QLFR-CML also shows its capacity to improve smaller models even with limited computational resources.

#### Summary
This study introduced Quartet Logic: A Four-Step Reasoning (QLFR) framework for short-text classification tasks and a CoT-Driven Multi-task learning (QLFR-CML) method. Both of these approaches use the reasoning chain of large language models to address challenges in the STC field. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of these methods.
