#### Background
- **Background**
This paper discusses the importance of social media advertising in brand marketing, aiming to attract consumers with captivating captions and logos or images. Brand personality has been proven to influence consumer behavior and social interactions and is thus a critical component of marketing strategies. Yet, incorporating brand personalities into caption generation for social media remains an uncharted area.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research focuses on generating captions for general images but fails to address how to integrate brand personalities into social media captions. Current open-source multimodal LLMs are not suited for this task, prompting the need for a new solution presented in the paper.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a two-part framework**
  - **Challenge 1: Generating consistent and attractive social media captions**
    The difficulty lies in producing plain English captions that match the image intended for online posting. The paper addresses this issue with the first part of the image captioning model.

  - **Challenge 2: Aligning generated captions with target brand personality**
    For the problem of aligning generated captions with specific brand personalities, the paper combines the generated caption and target brand personality, outputting a catchy and aligned social media caption through the LLM framework to overcome this challenge.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The method proposed in the paper demonstrated its qualitative and quantitative effectiveness in comparative evaluations. The system's first part is an image captioning model used to generate simple English captions for the image intended for online posting; the second part then takes the generated captions and target brand personality to produce engaging and personality-aligned social media captions. Additionally, the system allows the user to include in the captions the hashtags, Instagram handles, URLs, and named entities they want, making the captions more semantically relevant and related.

#### Summary
The paper introduces a new framework designed to aid brands in creating engaging captions on social media that align with their brand image and personality. The framework, which consists of two parts, successfully addresses the challenge of generating socially engaging and relevant captions for brands.
