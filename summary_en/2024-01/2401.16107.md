#### Background
- **Background**
Automatic diagnosis, an important application of AI in healthcare, typically involves generating diagnoses from patients' symptom descriptions. Conventionally, patients first consult a general practitioner and might be referred to domain-specific specialists for more comprehensive evaluations. The final diagnosis often results from collaborative consultations among medical specialist groups. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great capabilities in natural language understanding.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research has predominantly addressed automatic diagnostics by modeling the relationship between normalized symptoms and all potential diseases, neglecting real-life clinical processes for diagnosis. Furthermore, the impact of implicit symptoms in diagnoses, which are critical in clinical settings, is often overlooked.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced an LLM-based Multi-Specialist Agent Consultation model (AMSC)**
  - **Challenge 1: How to simulate the real-world diagnostic process?**
    The paper proposes a framework simulating the real-world consultation process of physicians by using open-source LLMs as primary healthcare workers and specialized LLM-based agents to represent experts with specific medical knowledge. These agents, informed by different medical domains, generate predictive distributions for potential diseases and leverage an adaptive probability distribution fusion method to refine the decision-making process for disease diagnosis.

  - **Challenge 2: How to improve the efficiency and practical utility of automatic diagnostics?**
    The approach established by the paper is more efficient in terms of training costs as it surpasses existing baselines in performance and only requires parameter training on the distribution fusion.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experimental outcomes indicate that the AMSC framework performs better than existing baseline methodologies. The model is also more efficient in terms of training costs as it only requires parameter training on the probability distribution fusion. Additionally, the study conducts an in-depth analysis of the role of implicit symptoms in automatic diagnosis, evaluating how different symptoms influence diagnostic outcomes.

#### Summary
This research introduces an LLM-based automatic diagnostic methodâ€”Multi-Specialist Agent Consultation Model (AMSC), which better simulates the diagnostic process in the real world and improves diagnosis accuracy and efficiency by integrating predictions from multiple specialized agents.
