#### Background
- **Background**
The paper delves into the study of adaptability and adherence of intelligent agents to evolving social norms. Current research often focuses on enhancing agents' capabilities or enabling them to perform a broader range of tasks, but as agents' abilities advance, the importance of researching agent supervision and alignment becomes increasingly significant.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work concentrates on empowering agents without sufficiently addressing the agents' evolution and alignment with dynamic social norms in changing settings.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced an EvolutionaryAgent framework**
      - **Challenge 1: Evaluating Agent Alignment**
      The challenge is how to evaluate an agentâ€™s adherence to social norms in environments where these norms are dynamically changing. The solution is based on evaluating agents by their behavior trajectory and statements regarding social norms, using social evaluators, which could be humans, LLMs, or model-assisted human overseers, to provide natural language feedback, helping agents adjust their behaviors to better adapt to the social environment and enhance alignment with societal norms.
        
      - **Challenge 2: Agent Survival and Evolution**
      The challenge lies in maintaining and enhancing agents' alignment with current societal norms and determining which agents can continue to exist in the society. The proposed method calculates the adaptiveness scores of all agents, selecting the best-aligned agents for reproducing, thereby replacing less adaptive agents. Through random selection and genetic mutation, this process aims to produce offspring more likely to align with current societal norms.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The researchers designed an information framework for the virtual society and its agent attributes, including personas, views, and careers. They set a time frame from the year 2000 to 2050, with each decade representing a generation, within which societal norms evolve. The study employs GPT-4 to generate questionnaires for evaluating social norms of agents dynamically. The evaluation model outputs a fitness score and feedback for each agent. Experiments were conducted three times, and the average values were reported as the final results.

#### Summary
This paper introduces an EvolutionaryAgent framework to assess and enhance the adaptiveness and alignment of large intelligent agents in dynamic and constantly evolving societal norms. The research highlights the significance of agent alignment with societal norms during evolution and validates the framework's efficacy through experiments.
