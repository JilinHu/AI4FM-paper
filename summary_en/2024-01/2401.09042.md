#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the breakthroughs achieved by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains and highlights the increasing interest in exploring their reasoning abilities, a key feature of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

- **Existing Work**
Existing work suggests that LLMs, using in-context few-shot (zero-shot) prompting techniques, can perform well on benchmarks without training. However, there is debate that these benchmarks are relatively simple in task-solving logic and only require shallow reasoning, which may not justify the claims about LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

#### Core Contributions
- **Comprehensive evaluation method for LLMs' relational reasoning capabilities**
  - **Challenge 1: Limitations and shortcomings in relational reasoning**
      The paper reveals that the relational reasoning abilities of the current state-of-the-art LLMs are far from perfect, displaying noticeable inferiority compared to neural program induction models. The authors contribute by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' relational reasoning ability using an evaluation module they developed.

  - **Challenge 2: Development of tools and an evaluation module**
      The authors implemented a sample generator that creates truth-value matrices representing the input-output relationships, developed a (tv nl)-modality compiler to convert samples from truth-value prompting to natural language prompting, and established an evaluation module to assess the performance and generalization capabilities from both truth-value and natural language sources under IID and OOD settings.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper conducted an evaluation of the relational reasoning abilities of LLMs using standard natural language prompting, comparing the results with those of neural program induction models (DLM) using few-shot training. Despite significant achievements by LLMs on easier tasks, their performance deteriorated markedly on tasks requiring more complex task-solving logic. For instance, while the GPT-4 model scored a 100% F1-score on the HasFather task, it struggled with the IsUncle task, which is more complex. Among all evaluated LLMs, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4 outperformed others in both test performance and OOD generalization, likely due to their larger sizes and more extensive pretraining data. However, the performance of LLMs was still inferior compared to DLM.

#### Summary
The paper primarily examines the capacities and constraints of large language models in the area of relational reasoning. Through extensive assessments, including novel testing procedures and an evaluation module, the findings indicate that while LLMs perform reasonably well on certain relational reasoning tasks, they are outperformed by models specifically designed for logical reasoning.
