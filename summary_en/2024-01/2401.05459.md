#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the concept and application of Personal Large Language Model Agents (Personal LLM Agents), which are deeply integrated with personal data, devices, and services, aiming to assist users in reducing repetitive and cumbersome work, allowing them to focus more on interesting and important affairs.
- **Existing Work**
At a stage where the software stack and ecosystem for personal LLM agents are still in their infancy, many important questions regarding system design and implementation remain unclear, and existing studies have not fully explored these issues.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced the concept and architecture of personal LLM agents**
      - **Challenge 1: Unclear System Architecture**
          The paper analyzes the primary limitations and future trends of existing intelligent personal assistants in the industry and academia during the era of large language models. Then it collects insights from domain experts in the area of LLM and personal agents, proposing a generic system architecture and a definition of intelligence levels, which is crucial for addressing the challenges faced by personal LLM agents during the design and implementation phases.
      - **Challenge 2: Integration of Technical Issues and Expert Opinions**
          The paper provides a literature review on the key technical aspects of personal LLM agents, including fundamental capabilities, efficiency, security & privacy, and reports aggregated results of experts' opinions on common questions related to the deployment of personal LLM agents. This offers important insights for design choices and potential deployment challenges for personal LLM agents.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper reviews three technical aspects related to personal LLM agents: fundamental capabilities, efficiency, and security & privacy. Each aspect is broken down into different research problems, and the main techniques involved with the problem are summarized, followed by an introduction of related work. This provides comprehensive theoretical support for understanding personal LLM agents and outlines potential solutions. The paper does not offer specific implementation details or experimental evaluation data, as it focuses more on summarizing existing research findings and expert opinions.

#### Summary
As a survey work, the paper presents the current status, challenges, and future trends of personal LLM agents and proposes a generic system architecture and intelligence level definition.
