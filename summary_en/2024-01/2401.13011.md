#### Background
- **Background**
This paper introduces a novel generative model called "Collaborative Competitive Agents (CCA)," which utilizes multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents to accomplish complex tasks. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the CCA system includes two generator agents and a discriminator agentâ€”all of equal status. The generator agents independently follow user instructions to generate results, while the discriminator evaluates the output and offers feedback for the generators to revise and improve the outcomes. Unlike previous generative models, the CCA system can capture the intermediate steps of the generation process, increasing transparency and allowing each generator to learn from other agents' successful executions, fostering collaborative competition to enhance the system's result quality and robustness. The study is primarily focused on image editing, proving CCA's robustness in handling complex instructions.

- **Existing Work**
Existing generative models like GANs and diffusion models have limited capabilities in processing complex, compound tasks and updating generated results. For instance, they struggle with multifaceted tasks that involve multiple subtasks; also, maintaining a compute graph for result updates is challenging, limiting the possibility of learning from other generative models. These inherent limitations of existing models contribute to a lack of quality and robustness when addressing specific types of tasks.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a novel generative model (CCA)**
    - **Challenge 1: Handling complex compound tasks**
        Employing the powerful task decomposition abilities of LLM-based intelligent agents, the CCA model can efficiently manage highly complex tasks. Insights into how agents comprehend, dissect, and execute tasks enable the modification of internal steps to improve outcomes. The increased transparency allows agents to learn from other agents' successful executions, enhancing the system's quality and robustness.

    - **Challenge 2: Improving quality and robustness of generated results**
        The two generator agents of the CCA system must reflect on the feedback provided by the discriminator and consider the outcomes produced by the other generator agent to improve their generation process, achieving iterative optimization. This collaborative competition perpetually augments the quality and robustness of the system's results.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Based on the abstract description, the CCA system demonstrated its ability to handle complex instructions within the realm of image editing through experiments. The code is publicly available, allowing other researchers to replicate and compare results. Although details of the implementation and evaluation results were not provided in the abstract, the paper's contributions include introducing a multi-agent-based generative model and a thorough examination of agent relationships, as well as extensive experiments in image editing, suggesting a positive outcome that showcases the advantages of the CCA system over other works.

#### Summary
The paper presents a new generative model based on multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of handling complex image editing tasks and enhancing the quality and robustness of the results. Encouraging collaborative competition among agents, the model demonstrates capabilities exceeding traditional methods, especially in managing complex tasks and learning from intermediate steps to refine outcomes.
