#### Background
- **Background**
The paper acknowledges that current large language models (LLMs) excel in generating standalone functions but face limitations in repository-level code generation due to a lack of awareness of repository-level dependencies, resulting in dependency errors such as undefined-variable and no-member errors.

- **Existing Work**
Existing efforts have not successfully addressed the dependency awareness issue faced by code LLMs in repository-level code generation.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced the novel approach known as TOOLGEN**
  - **Challenge 1: Dependency Issues**
      TOOLGEN addresses dependency issues by integrating autocompletion tools into the code generation process of LLMs. It does so through Data Augmentation and Model Fine-tuning (Offline phase) by marking positions to trigger autocompletion tools with a special mark token and fine-tuning code LLMs based on these augmented functions. In the Online phase, TOOLGEN iteratively generates functions and invokes the autocompletion tool when encountering the mark token, effectively resolving dependency problems and enhancing the quality of code generation.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper elaborates on the implementation of TOOLGEN, including Data Augmentation, Model Fine-tuning, and Tool-integrated Code Generation. To evaluate TOOLGEN's effectiveness, a benchmark was created encompassing 12744 Python functions from 680 real-world code repositories, and two new repository-level metrics were introduced: Dependency Coverage and Success Rate. Experimental results show that TOOLGEN significantly improved dependency coverage by 15.2% to 45.8% and success rates by 10.9% to 42.2% across three different code LLMs, while maintaining competitive performance on widely-recognized similarity metrics such as BLEU-4, CodeBLEU, and Edit Similarity.

#### Summary
This paper successfully presented a novel approach, TOOLGEN, which integrates autocompletion tools into the repository-level code generation process of LLMs, solving dependency issues and boosting both the quality and success rate of code generation.
