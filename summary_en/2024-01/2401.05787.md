#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper highlights that existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often don’t adequately ground their reasoning processes within specific contexts, called the 'context grounding' problem. For example, methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting don’t specifically leverage the given context when reasoning and sometimes make internal assumptions or imaginary hypotheses not pertinent to the query, leading to incorrect outcomes.
    
- **Existing Work**
The current work does not solve this issue effectively, resulting in answers that are often logically unsound or incorrectly reasoned. The paper’s analysis found a high error rate; up to 23% of wh-questions and 25% of yes/no questions were categorized as lacking context-based reasoning.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced an Evidence to Generate (E2G) Prompting**
    - **Challenge 1: Weak Link in Chain of Reasoning**
        Even the state-of-the-art LLMs, when using CoT prompts to generate answers and reasoning, often come up with explanations that are hallucinated and cannot be verified against the context. The paper introduces the E2G framework, which prompts models to generate the rationales or evidence from the context along with the answer, significantly reducing the error rate by grounding each step of reasoning within context and thus reducing conjecture and hallucinatory statements.
      
    - **Challenge 2: Complexity of the Task**
        Some reasoning tasks are inherently complex, potentially involving multiple steps or sources of information. E2G simplifies the complexity of tasks by employing a two-step prompting approach, where the first step is to guide the model to generate the evidence or rationales for the output answer, thereby reducing errors; in the second step, the model uses evidence from the first step as the new context to reach the final answer. This method helps reduce the complexity of processing information while maintaining task simplification and practicality.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Researchers evaluated E2G on a variety of context-intensive language tasks, involving eight different reasoning tasks, using ChatGPT, GPT-4, and PALM (540B) as the backbone models for the experiments. Depending on the task, researchers proposed two variants of E2G, namely E2G-base and E2G-Pro, and adjusted the usage of these methods based on the size of the task context. Evaluation on the DROP dataset showed that E2G performed better than CoT, with noticeable improvements in EM (Exact Match) and F1 scores. These results confirm the effectiveness of the E2G method in improving context-grounded reasoning abilities.

#### Summary
This paper introduced a new single-agent, two-step prompting framework—Evidence to Generate (E2G) —aimed at improving the context reasoning abilities of LLMs. By prompting LLMs to generate evidence and explanations alongside answers, E2G reduces erroneous reasoning and enhances the accuracy of models handling various reasoning tasks. Experimental results showed that the E2G method outperforms CoT in multiple context-intensive language tasks.
