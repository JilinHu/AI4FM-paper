#### Background
- **Background**
The paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for conversational question-answering. Current approaches lack adequate handling of multi-turn conversations and background knowledge, making the improvement of LLM's QA abilities in dialogue contexts a critical research focus.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research has dealt with conversational questions through pretrained models and single-turn QA, but when faced with complex situations involving multi-turn dialogue and the need for background knowledge, performance is still limited. Moreover, most studies have not focused on everyday conversational QA scenarios beyond specialized knowledge.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a two-stage instruction tuning framework called ChatQA**
    - **Challenge 1: Multi-turn conversational QA and deep semantic understanding**  
      The approach starts with a pretrained LLM foundation model and applies Stage-1: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to enable the model to understand and follow everyday dialogue instructions. It involves unifying various SFT data into a conversational format and applying fine-tuning to the LLM foundation model.
      
    - **Challenge 2: Background knowledge and information retrieval capabilities**  
      In Stage-2, they introduced Context-Enhanced Instruction Tuning, specifically designed to enhance the model's capability for context-aware or retrieval-augmented generation in conversational QA. This stage integrates contextual QA datasets into the instruction tuning blend to further enhance the model's QA capabilities.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper conducted experiments using multiple datasets, showing that the ChatQA model performs well in multi-turn conversational QA tasks. The model demonstrates strong results on standard QA benchmarks and can explicitly indicate when it cannot find an answer to a question, reducing the occurrence of hallucinated responses. Additionally, comparisons with existing models like GPT-3.5-turbo confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of ChatQA.

#### Summary
The ChatQA model significantly improved the effectiveness of multi-turn conversational QA through a two-stage instruction tuning strategy, particularly in areas of context understanding and information retrieval.
