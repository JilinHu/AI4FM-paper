#### Background
- **Background**
This paper discusses a pervasive issue in large language models (LLMs): the propensity to generate content that seems plausible on the surface but is factually incorrect, a phenomenon known as hallucination. This tendency presents significant obstacles to the trustworthy and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications, such as in clinical diagnoses, where the reliable generation of trustworthy text is critical.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research has focused on three questions: why LLMs hallucinate, how to detect hallucinations, and how to mitigate them. Current studies mainly concentrate on analyzing or addressing individual challenges and lack systematic and in-depth empirical research on the phenomenon of hallucinations in LLMs. The limitation of existing work is the lack of comprehensive analysis to fully research these issues.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a comprehensive study**
    - **Challenge 1: How to detect hallucinations in LLMs**
      The paper proposes a new detection framework and benchmark, HaluEval 2.0, by simplifying the detection process into extracting factual statements from LLM responses and determining whether these statements contain hallucinations. Experiments were conducted to explore the sources of hallucinations.
      
    - **Challenge 2: How to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs**
      Hallucination mitigation was addressed by a series of widely used techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), retrieval augmentation, self-reflection, advanced decoding, and prompt improvements, analyzing their effectiveness in reducing hallucinations.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Key findings from the empirical study include the following: in pre-training, increasing the amount of training data has a marginal effect on reducing hallucinations, while incorporating domain-specific data can greatly alleviate hallucinations in specific fields. In fine-tuning, LLMs with improved instructions can mitigate hallucinations, and balancing the complexity of instructions helps reduce the level of hallucination, while overly complex instructions lead to a higher level of hallucinations. In inference, diversity-oriented decoding methods induce more hallucinations in professional domains, while greedy search exacerbates open-ended domain problems. In prompt design, incorporating more task details and leveraging in-context learning can decrease the level of hallucinations. These findings provide new insights into understanding and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.

#### Summary
The paper provides a systematic empirical study to deeply understand and explore the problem of hallucinations in large language models, identifying the sources of hallucination, detection methods, mitigation strategies, and proposing the new benchmark HaluEval 2.0 and a simple yet effective hallucination detection framework.
