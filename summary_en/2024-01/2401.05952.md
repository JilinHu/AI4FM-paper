#### Background
- **Background**
The paper outlines the increase in the usage of machine-generated text (MGT) due to the rapid advancement and widespread applications of large language models (LLMs), which introduces risks to the quality and completeness of information in areas like news and education.

- **Existing Work**
The existing body of research primarily handles the detection of pure MGT, inadequately addressing situations that include mixtures of AI-revised human-written text (HWT) or human-revised MGT, failing to consider these mixed scenarios in a formalized manner.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced the new concept of mixcase and the MIXSET dataset**
    - **Challenge 1: Defining and detecting mixed scenarios**
        The concept of mixcase—a novel form of mixed text containing both AI and human-generated content—provides a fresh perspective for research. The paper proposes the MIXSET dataset, specifically aimed at addressing the mixture of MGT and HWT, covering a wide range of operations within real-world scenarios, thus filling a void in previous research.

    - **Challenge 2: Evaluating the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of detectors**
        Extensive experiments with mainstream detectors based on MIXSET highlighted the difficulty existing detectors have in identifying mixcase, particularly with subtle modifications and style adaptability, presenting a challenge for the recognition of mixed text.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experimental findings indicate that existing detectors have difficulties recognizing mixcase as a distinct category or MGT, especially when dealing with subtle modifications and adaptability in style. Furthermore, transfer experiments were conducted on retrained detectors to analyze their generalizability on mixcase from various editing operations and LLMs.

#### Summary
This study defined the mixed text (mixcase) found in mixed scenarios, created the MIXSET dataset, and provided insights and directions for solving the detection problem of mixed text. It revealed that existing detectors have shortcomings in recognizing mixcase, underlining the urgent need for more fine-grained detectors.
