#### Background
- **Background**
This paper discusses the challenges of multivariate time series forecasting, highlighting the difficulties encountered by large pretrained models in this domain due to the diversity of data and scarcity of publicly available pretraining data.

- **Existing Work**
The existing work has implemented efficient alternatives to transformer architectures, such as TSMixer, which uses the MLP-Mixer architecture. However, due to the varied nature of datasets across applications and limited availability of public pretraining data, these advanced approaches fail to demonstrate the ability to create general pretrained models capable of successful transfer learning to unseen target time series datasets. Self-supervised pretraining methods for time series, such as SimMTM, Ti-MAE, and TF-C, are limited to transfer learning between carefully selected datasets. Meanwhile, the trend has been to utilize large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting, treating it as a cross-domain transfer learning task. While these methods show promise in few/zero-shot forecasting, they do not adequately address controllable and uncontrollable variables specific to multivariate forecasting, and suffer from high computational requirements due to the size of the models.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced Multi-level Tiny Time Mixers (TTM)**
  - **Challenge 1: Effective Pretraining on Diverse Public Datasets With Varying Resolutions**
      TTM tackles the complexity of pretraining on multiple datasets with varied temporal resolutions by introducing novel enhancements such as adaptive patching, dataset augmentation via downsampling, and resolution prefix tuning.

  - **Challenge 2: Integrating Cross-channel Correlations and Exogenous Signals**
      The paper presents a multi-level modeling strategy that explicitly models channel correlations and infuses exogenous signals during finetuning, addressing a crucial capability lacking in existing LLM-TS models.

#### Implementation and Deployment
TTM achieves significant gains in accuracy (12-38%) over existing benchmarks in few/zero-shot forecasting tasks. It has also managed to reduce the model's parameters by 14-106X, leading to a 54-65X improvement in training/inference speeds when compared to LLM-TS benchmarks. Remarkably, TTM's zero-shot results often surpass many few-shot results in benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The code and pretrained models will be made open-source.

#### Summary
TTM demonstrates the effectiveness and transfer learning capabilities of tiny pretrained models that are exclusively trained on diverse time series data for improved multivariate time series forecasting in few/zero-shot scenarios.
