#### Background
- **Background**       
Large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded and been integrated into domains such as robotics task planning, leveraging their advanced reasoning and language comprehension to develop action plans from natural language instructions. However, they encounter challenges with embodied tasks that involve complex environment interactions due to their lack of compatibility with robotic visual perception.

- **Existing Work**
The paper provides a detailed overview of the integration of LLMs and multimodal LLMs in various robotic tasks and proposes a framework that uses multimodal GPT-4V to improve embodied task planning by combining natural language instructions and robot visual perceptions. Results from diverse datasets indicate GPT-4V's effectiveness in enhancing robot performance in embodied tasks. This comprehensive survey and evaluation offer insights for enriching the concept of LLM-centric embodied intelligence and bridging the gap in Human-Robot-Environment interaction.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Proposed a Framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Lack of Compatibility with Robotic Visual Perception**
      LLMs that only use text struggle to interpret environmental information, limiting their efficiency in decision-making and task planning within complex settings. By integrating multimodal GPT-4V, which combines natural language instructions and robotic visual perceptions, the framework addresses this limitation and enhances the performance of LLMs in embodied tasks.
      
    - **Challenge 2: Difficulty in Acquiring Large and Diverse Robot Interaction Datasets**
      Existing robot interaction datasets are often limited to a single environment or emphasize specific task domains, complicating the integration of LLMs across varying tasks. The paper tackles this complexity by meticulously reviewing and analyzing existing literature and proposing new methods for task planning and manipulation using multimodal LLMs, aiming to effectively leverage LLMs in diverse environments and tasks.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments with various datasets demonstrated the capacity of GPT-4V to improve robotics performance across different tasks. The framework's ability to convert natural language instructions into machine-understandable code and integrate real sensor modalities data enables robots to understand and execute commands from users. Employing GPT-4V, researchers compared and scored generated task plans against actual task plans, showcasing GPT-4V's potential in advancing robotics toward more complex and human-like tasks.

#### Summary
The multimodal GPT-4V framework proposed in the paper, which combines NLP and visual perception, aims to tackle challenges faced by LLMs in robotic task planning. It holds significant implications for advancing human-machine interaction and shaping the future of intelligent AI systems.
