#### Background
- **Background**
    The paper introduces a method known as "Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT)" prompting to improve the problem-solving efficiency of large language models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It argues that efficiency can be maintained by reducing verbose outputs while preserving answer accuracy.
- **Existing Work**
    There has been little direct study of concise prompting, with most insights drawn from best practices in real-world applications. Furthermore, there is a dearth of literature specifically exploring concise CoT prompting, leaving a gap in understanding the potential impact of concise prompting on problem-solving performances by large language models.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a new method**
    - **Challenge 1: Reducing the verbosity of large language model outputs**
        The CCoT method addresses this challenge by adding an instruction for the model to answer "concisely," helping to cut down on output length while ensuring that problem-solving performance is unaffected through comparative studies.
    - **Challenge 2: Validating the effectiveness of CCoT prompts compared to standard CoT prompts**
        By comparing CCoT with standard CoT on various standardized question and answer benchmarks and using Mann-Whitney U tests to validate the significance of the differences, it was found that CCoT not only significantly reduced the output length but also maintained near-identical accuracy in correct answers.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Researchers used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to test the effects of CCoT versus standard CoT across multiple problem domains and levels of difficulty. Experiments show that CCoT prompts resulted in a significant reduction in average response length (47.62% and 49.77%, respectively), and these reductions were statistically significant and meaningful. These findings suggest that CCoT can effectively reduce model output lengths without sacrificing the accuracy of answers.

#### Summary
The study demonstrates that concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting can significantly reduce the length of text outputs in large language models without compromising performance in problem-solving tasks.
