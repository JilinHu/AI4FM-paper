#### Background
- **Background**
The paper explores the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate coherent text and questions whether they are equally proficient at forming coherent probability judgments. LLMs can produce coherent passages even when occasionally generating "hallucinated" or factually incorrect information, leading to an investigation into the coherence of their judgments.
  
- **Existing Work**
Existing research has focused on LLMs' capabilities in predicting individual words and interacting with humans in real-world applications, with aim to align AI-generated probabilities with true frequencies. Ensuring the accuracy of AI-produced probability judgments is crucial, but so is their coherence. Coherence is theoretically linked to accuracy in boundedly rational agents, which is not fully addressed in the existing work.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a framework for assessing the coherence of probability judgments in LLMs**
    - **Challenge 1: Quantifying the incoherence of probability judgments**
      The researchers employed a series of probabilistic identities to quantitatively assess the incoherence. Coherent judgments should yield a value of zero according to these identities, and any deviation is an indicator of incoherence. Consistency over time/information was tested by submitting the same prompts repeatedly to evaluate variability in responses.

    - **Challenge 2: Explaining human-like biases in LLMs' probability judgments**
      The hypothesis that human-like patterns in LLMs' probability judgments might be due to autoregressive training objectives was proposed. The study examined two computational models explaining human probability judgmentsâ€”the Probability Theory plus Noise (PT+N) model, and the Bayesian Sampler model. The results aligned more closely with the Bayesian Sampler model, indicating guidance by Bayesian inference, suggesting a better match for neural network behavior over the PT+N model's characterization based on probability theory with noise.

#### Implementation and Deployment
In the study, LLMs were tasked with estimating probabilities of various events set in 2025. A set of probabilistic identities was used to assess the coherence of these judgments. Researchers found that state-of-the-art LLMs displayed biases resembling those found in human cognition, and when repeatedly queried about the same event at a temperature setting of 1.0, the mean and variance of probability judgments displayed an inverted-U shape pattern similar to that derived from human probability judgments.

#### Summary
The paper investigates the coherence of probability judgments made by large language models, finding biases comparable to systemic deviations in human cognition. It quantified incoherence using probabilistic identities and repetition of judgments. The hypothesis presented connects the human-like biases observed when LLMs make probability judgments to their autoregressive training objectives, supported by potential links between the Bayesian Sampler model and autoregressive processes within LLMs.
