#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper discusses the widespread application of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in modern machine learning, their remarkable proficiency in various important machine learning tasks, and the trend towards larger models with more parameters, which require substantial computing resources for both training and inference.
- **Existing Work**       
Previous studies indicate that neural networks, particularly those that are massively over-parameterized at training time, can be drastically pruned before inference, often without significant performance degradation even when over 90% of the weights are removed.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a method called Layer-Selective Rank reduction (LASER)**
  - **Challenge 1: Enhancing performance of LLMs**
    The challenge lies in finding a more specific strategy to improve the performance of Transformer models on certain tasks. The authors present the LASER approach, selectively pruning higher-order components of weight matrices in specific layers of the Transformer to significantly enhance model performance.

  - **Challenge 2:**
    The authors claim that their paper is the first to identify that carefully selected rank reductions can boost Transformer performance, suggesting that previous works have not fully addressed the issue of enhancing reasoning abilities of models through targeted complexity reduction, especially at selected layers.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper has yet to provide detailed experimental results and comparisons with related work. Further reading will be required to obtain this information.

#### Summary
The paper introduces LASER, a strategy for pruning specific layers of the Transformer model after training to enhance its performance. The authors indicate that this strategy is not only effective, but also the first discovery of enhancing the performance of Transformer models through carefully selected pruning.
