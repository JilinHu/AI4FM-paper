#### Background
- **Background**
The rise in large language models (LLMs) and their impressive performance in a myriad of tasks has spurred attempts to utilize LLMs within drug discovery. Notably, however, molecule optimization—a pivotal element within drug discovery—has seen meager LLM engagement. Current methodologies primarily capture patterns within chemical structures offered by data without employing expert feedback.

- **Existing Work**
Established models either represent molecules as sequences generating optimized molecular sequences through data inputs, or portray molecules as graphs and conceptualize optimization as a graph-to-graph translation issue. These models fall short of interactive capabilities, neglect the iterative refinement essential within drug discovery, and often fail to address the need for simultaneous multi-property optimization, a more representative task of real-life scenarios.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced DrugAssist**
    - **Challenge 1: Lack of interactivity in molecular optimization approaches**
        DrugAssist utilizes LLMs' strong interactivity and generalizability to aid molecule optimization through human-machine dialogue, enabling multi-turn conversations so experts can refine the generated molecules, addressing the absence of interactivity in traditional methods.

    - **Challenge 2: The need for multi-property optimization**
        DrugAssist stands out in multi-property optimization, a less addressed but more challenging aspect of molecule optimization. It excels in maintaining optimized molecular properties within a targeted range, meeting real-world optimization challenges rather than simply altering property values.

#### Implementation and Deployment
DrugAssist is an interactive model, instruction-tuned on Llama2-7B-Chat, which performs molecule optimization via human-machine interaction. A large instruction-based dataset "MolOpt-Instructions" for fine-tuning language models on molecule optimization tasks was also released. DrugAssist has outperformed traditional and LLM-based approaches in multi-property optimization tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

#### Summary
DrugAssist is a model that facilitates molecule optimization through human-machine interaction, overcoming the lack of interactivity limitations in LLM applications for drug discovery and showcasing superior multi-property optimization abilities.
