#### Background
- **Background**
Game theory is an analytical tool frequently used to study human behavior in the domain of social sciences. With the behavioral alignment between Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, LLMs present a promising direction as substitutes for human participants in game experiments to enable social science research.
- **Existing Work**
Existing work lacks systematic analysis of LLMs in the context of game theory. While empirical research indicates the potential of LLMs to replace humans in social science research, the capability boundaries of LLMs remain unclear.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Challenge 1: Establishing clear desires**
    LLMs struggle to construct desires based on uncommon preferences, showing decreased mathematical abilities and the inability to understand preferences.

  - **Challenge 2: Refining beliefs about uncertainty in games**
    LLMs fail to refine belief from many straightforward patterns, suggesting pessimism about LLMs participating in games that require refining complex beliefs.
  
  - **Challenge 3: Taking optimal actions based on desires and beliefs**
    LLMs may overlook or modify refined beliefs when taking actions, which is an unavoidable issue in LLMs.
  
#### Implementation and Deployment
Experimental results reveal significant disparities between state-of-the-art LLMs, like GPT-4, and human performance in game theory. For example, GPT-4, while showcasing human-like performance in recognizing patterns and increasing confidence in beliefs as game information grows in Rock-Paper-Scissors, fails to refine belief from several simple patterns. In the dictator game, LLMs demonstrate the basic ability to form clear desires, but they struggle with uncommon preferences. Moreover, in the ring-network game, while explicit decomposition of behavior during the game process improves LLMs' actions, the tendency to overlook or modify refined beliefs persists.

#### Summary
This research systematically explores the capability boundaries of LLMs within the context of game theory and provides insights for integrating LLMs into social science research from three distinct perspectives.
