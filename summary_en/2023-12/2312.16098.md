#### Background
- **Background**       
    This paper studies work done using Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot listwise reranking. Although such methods have reported some success and state-of-the-art results, they rely on massive models with billions of parameters and limited context sizes, which introduce challenges in computational demand.

- **Existing Work**
    Existing methods for training LLMs for listwise reranking rely on training using external passage relevance labels, which may be judgments from human referees or rankings generated by a teacher model. This strategy contrasts with methods that leverage LLMs' intrinsic ability to understand and process information for ranking purposes.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Presented LiT5-Distill and LiT5-Score**
      - **Challenge 1: How to reduce model size without impacting effectiveness**
          The research introduces two methods, LiT5-Distill and LiT5-Score, which demonstrate reranking effectiveness comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models even with dramatically smaller sizes. This challenges the necessity of large-scale models for effective zero-shot reranking and opens avenues for more efficient listwise reranking solutions.

      - **Challenge 2: How to eliminate the reliance on external passage relevance labels for training rerankers**
          The LiT5-Score method explores the use of cross-attention to calculate relevance scores for reranking, thereby eliminating the reliance on external passage relevance labels for training. Moreover, this showcases that FiD models with cross-attention scoring can interpret and respond to queries based on context passages, effectively enabling reranking.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Results on the MS MARCO and BEIR datasets indicate that models with significantly fewer parameters can still achieve reranking effectiveness on par with much larger models. The study also improved the efficiency and accuracy by adding new features on top of the existing sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder reranking models.

#### Summary
The paper introduces LiT5-Distill and LiT5-Score, two sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder models for efficient zero-shot listwise reranking. These methods not only offer competitive performance but also address traditional reliance on large LLMs and external relevance labels, showcasing optimization and advancement in this domain.
