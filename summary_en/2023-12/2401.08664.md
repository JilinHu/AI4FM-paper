#### Background
- **Background**
    The paper discusses the possibility of adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to the education system, focusing on the significant development of LLMs' education-related abilities, as well as the need to integrate various capabilities in real-world learning scenarios to form responses.

- **Existing Work**
    The paper mentions that there is still limited research on the integration of multiple interdisciplinary capabilities for LLMs, especially in terms of dataset and algorithm design. Although some studies have discussed the role of LLMs in connecting knowledge across disciplines to facilitate interdisciplinary work, these primarily address LLMs' ability to assist researchers in interdisciplinary cooperation, not their ability to answer interdisciplinary questions. Thus, cultivating LLMs's ability in this regard, to develop a unified education system, is a key research direction.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Presented an overview of LLM-based education system development**
      - **Challenge 1: Answering Interdisciplinary Questions**
        Current research on LLMs is mostly focused on single domains, while in the real world, education systems often need to synthesize various knowledge and skills. LLMs have not yet shown proficiency in dealing with such compound questions.
    
      - **Challenge 2: Student Modeling**
        Establishing an LLM-based education system allows students to express individualized needs through dialogue, but this requires LLMs to extract personalized features from the conversation, such as the mastery of specific topics and learning style preferences shown in the dialogue.
    
      - **Challenge 3: Multi-modal Education**
        Dealing with common multi-modal information in education scenarios, such as geometry problems combining text and images, or textbook concepts with illustrations, requires the creation of a generalizable intelligent education system capable of processing such data.
  
#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper does not present specific experimental results or direct comparisons with other work, but rather provides a general overview of the development of the LLM-based education system, discusses its potential and proposes ways of building such a system. It also highlights future directions worth pursuing.

#### Summary
This paper is a survey on how to adapt large language models for the education system. It provides an overview of the development of LLMs in education-related capabilities, explores the potential and challenges in building such systems, and offers insights for future related research.
