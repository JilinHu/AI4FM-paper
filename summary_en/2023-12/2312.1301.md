#### Background
- **Background**
The paper outlines the breakthroughs of LLMs in the NLP field, especially code generation, and presents a challenge: how to balance effective test case generation with code snippet generation since they often cannot be well-managed together.

- **Existing Work**
In terms of enhancing the effectiveness of code generation, existing works like Self-Edit and CodeCoT proposed paths of self-improvement optimization, such as using manually written test cases by users to validate and enhance the accuracy of the generated code. However, these methods are limited, particularly in their dependency on test cases, which can be problematic for users, especially those who are not experts in the field. Moreover, these methods tend to balance between code generation and test case generation, which might affect the independence and effectiveness of testing.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Proposed AgentCoder**
    - **Challenge 1: Balancing code generation with test case generation**
     The paper introduced the AgentCoder framework that resolves the issue of mutual interference between code generation and test case generation by creating three collaborative agents (programmer agent, test designer agent, and test executor agent). This multi-agent system ensures robust code generation capabilities and solves the limitations of traditional methods.

    - **Challenge 2: Quality and iterative optimization of code generation**
     The programmer agent utilizes a Chain-of-Thought approach for iteratively optimizing the code generation, which not only produces initial code snippets but also self-corrects upon feedback from the test executor agent to ensure the final code snippet meets all test case requirements.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Evaluation of AgentCoder showed that it surpasses existing SOTA methods in terms of code quality. For example, AgentCoder achieved 77.4% and 89.1% pass rates in HumanEval-ET and MBPP-ET datasets, respectively, outperforming the existing best models that only managed 69.5% and 63.0% pass rates. These results confirm the effectiveness of AgentCoder in addressing the challenges posed, and its modular design ensures adaptability and scalability of the model, allowing for future enhancements and integration with more advanced models.

#### Summary
This paper presents a novel multi-agent-based solution for code generation, AgentCoder, which effectively solves the balance problem between code generation and testing through specific agents focused on code generation, test designing, and test execution, achieving code generation quality that outperforms existing SOTA methods.
