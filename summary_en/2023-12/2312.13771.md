#### Background
- **Background**
This paper introduces significant advances in large language models (LLMs), which have led to the development of intelligent agents able to perform complex tasks. Historically, LLM-based agents rely solely on text-based information, limiting their environmental perception and interaction.
  
- **Existing Work**
Current intelligent assistants for smartphones like Siri operate through system back-end access and function calls, which restricts their universality. Moreover, existing approaches require extensive training data for task-specific adaption, and creating a large dataset for app demonstrations is challenging.
  
#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a novel LLM-based multimodal agent framework**
  - **Challenge 1: Operating a variety of smartphone apps**
      The agent framework can operate any smartphone application like human users by mimicking human interactions such as tapping and swiping. It bypasses the need for system back-end access by learning to use new apps through exploratory learning and observing human demonstrations.
  
  - **Challenge 2: Ensuring long-term adaptability and flexibility**
      Interacting with low-level GUI operations rather than deep system integration, the agent adapts to changes in app interfaces and updates, enhancing security and privacy.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The research tested the agent's capabilities across 50 tasks in 10 different applications, including social media, email, maps, shopping, and complex image editing tools. The experimental results and user studies highlighted the design's adaptability, user-friendliness, efficient learning, and operating capabilities across a broad range of applications, showcasing the agent's potential in smartphone app operation.

#### Summary
The study introduces an innovative multimodal agent framework allowing the agent to operate any smartphone application like a human user by learning new apps through autonomous exploration and observing human demonstrations. Findings demonstrate the framework's efficiency and adaptability in performing a variety of advanced tasks.
