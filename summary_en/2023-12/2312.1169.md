#### Background
- **Background**
The study presents a comprehensive description of a chemist AI agent named Eunomia, designed to autonomously extract information from scientific literature. Utilizing a large language model (LLM) as its "brain," coupled with ReAct architecture for planning, it exhibits the capabilities of reasoning and action. The researchers applied this AI agent to materials NLP tasks with a focus on entity and relation extraction related to chemistry.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research has used large pretrained language models, like GPT-3, to extract information from unstructured text; however, these models require fine-tuning on a substantial set of manually annotated examples to be applied to specific tasks. This process can be labor-intensive and error-prone.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introducing a LLM-based Chemist AI Agent**
    - **Challenge 1: Automating Information Extraction and Structuring**
        Eunomia is capable of automated extraction and structuring of information without the need for fine-tuning. This is accomplished through Zero-Shot Learning and coupling with specific tools like Document Search (Doc Search) and Chain-of-Verification (CoV) tool, enhancing the agent's precision and reducing the likelihood of fabricating misinformation.
    
    - **Challenge 2: Mining Information from Complex Scientific Literature**
        AI agent's performance could diminish with increasing task complexity. Yet, with the unique tools provided by the AI agent, like Dataset Search and CSV Output Generator, researchers were able to enhance the AI agent's capability to mine information from complex scientific literature and save the results in structured files.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The evaluation of Eunomia measured the agent's performance across tasks of varying complexity using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics, comparing it against previously fine-tuned LLM models. The findings showed that Eunomia outperformed the LLM-NERRE benchmark in named entity recognition and relation extraction tasks and demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. The experiments also assessed the agent's capability for information recovery (yield) and its accuracy in predicting the water stability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).

#### Summary
This paper showcases the capability of an intelligence agent based on large language models to autonomously learn and extract material-related datasets from scientific literature. Eunomia demonstrated effectiveness in entity and relation extraction without any fine-tuning and could enhance its ability to avoid errors in complex tasks.
