#### Background
- **Background**
This paper describes the profound significance of few-shot learning for adapting to tasks with very few samples, particularly in clinical tasks due to the high annotation cost of medical images. Previous works on few-shot learning for medical images still required a large number of medical images for pre-training to gain domain-specific priors.
- **Existing Work**
Existing research still needed a considerable amount of data for fine-tuning, and with the domain disparities between medical and natural images, the challenge arises in adapting foundation models from natural images to few-shot clinical tasks effectively.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a method of fine-tuning with partial freezing**
  - **Challenge 1: Domain disparity and very limited samples**
        The paper addresses this by provoking a simple version of fine-tuning through freezing some shallow layers of the foundation model and subsequently fine-tuning other layers.
  - **Challenge 2: Providing effective semantic guidance**
        The study identified that using mere category names for model training could result in blurred inter-class relations due to high similarity across all categories. To overcome this, the paper proposed contextualizing labels using large language models (LLMs) to distinctly categorize similar diseases and achieve notable performance improvements.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The proposed approach won the first place in the NeurIPS 2023 MedFMC Challenge. Compared to standard fine-tuning methods, the paper's fine-tuning with partial freezing significantly outperformed and was highly efficient in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, the introduction of large language models for label contextualization facilitated separating different lesion types' embeddings, yielding an increase in performance of 3%-5% in 1-shot settings over common one-hot labels and other semantic guidance methods.

#### Summary
The paper contributed to few-shot medical image classification by presenting an efficient fine-tuning approach through partial layer freezing and incorporating large language models for contextualizing labels to offer effective semantic guidance. The approach demonstrated exceptional performance in a challenge, indicating its effectiveness in adapting natural image models to medical image tasks in few-shot scenarios.
