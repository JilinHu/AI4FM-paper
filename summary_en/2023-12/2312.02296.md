#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper discusses the challenges in the field of medical information extraction, particularly the time and effort required for manual data annotation. Even though prior research has attempted to reduce the need for manual annotations by combining pre-trained language models (such as BERT) with active learning, these methods still require explicit model parameter tuning to adapt to data distributions and tasks.

- **Existing Work**
Existing methods require detailed tuning of model parameters to fit specific data distributions and tasks. This tuning process can be cumbersome and may not achieve the desired results in some cases.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced an LLM-based annotation workflow**
      - **Challenge 1: Enhancing Annotation Efficiency**
          The study proposed an LLM-based method that significantly enhances the efficiency of medical information extraction tasks by reducing the need for model parameter tuning.

      - **Challenge 2: Avoiding Complex Parameter Adjustments**
          This method speeds up medical information extraction annotation and reduces costs by eliminating the need for explicit tuning of the model.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The dataset used in the paper was a de-identified set of clinical discharge summaries provided by the 2009 i2b2 NLP challenge. It was divided into training, development, and test sets to evaluate the LLM annotation workflow at different stages. The LLM annotation workflow includes segmenting input documents into text chunks, designing task-specific few-shot prompts, generating textual outputs from LLM based on these prompts, and structuring the outputs into NER-RE objects. The evaluation results showed that the LLM method significantly improves annotation efficiency compared to traditional manual annotation methods.

#### Summary
The paper presents a method that uses large language models, specifically Google's PaLM 2, to enhance the speed of annotation in medical information extraction tasks. The LLM-based annotation workflow increases efficiency without complex model parameter adjustment, making it a promising tool for accelerating data annotation work in the medical field.
