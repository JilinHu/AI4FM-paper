#### Background
- **Background**
The paper introduces how Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of capturing a vast amount of factual information through massive pre-training datasets, but this knowledge is static and doesn't update over time. LLMs may also lack specific expertise in particular domains.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work indicates that fine-tuning can improve model performance to some extent. However, the ability of models to incorporate specific knowledge bases during training is limited, and models struggle to learn new factual information through fine-tuning.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Comparing Fine-Tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
      - **Challenge 1: Enhancing LLM capabilities on both existing and entirely new knowledge**
        By comparing the performance of fine-tuning and RAG on various knowledge-intensive tasks, the researchers found that while fine-tuning provides some improvement, RAG consistently outperforms fine-tuning on both existing knowledge encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. The study further shows that exposing models to numerous variations of the same fact could alleviate the problem of learning new factual information during fine-tuning.

      - **Challenge 2: Effectively evaluating models' knowledge injection performance**
        To evaluate the LLMs' performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, the researchers created a new multiple-choice dataset with the help of GPT-4, followed by manual evaluation and verification. Paraphrases of the dataset's input data were generated to maintain the full information while ensuring wording variety for hyperparameter tuning.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The implementation involved selecting popular open-source base models and an instruction-tuned model to represent various baseline capabilities; a state-of-the-art open-source embedding model and FAISS were utilized as its vector store. The evaluation included multiple configurations compared to baseline and fine-tuned models, and their performance with the RAG component. Additionally, they explored the optimal number of text chunks to add to the RAG context and tested both 0-shot and 5-shot performance scenarios. All models were trained using NVIDIA A-100 GPUs for up to 5 epochs, with learning rates found through a hyperparameter search between 1 x 10-6 and 5 x 10-5.

#### Summary
The study's core contribution lies in its comparison of fine-tuning and RAG methodologies for knowledge injection into LLMs, finding that RAG demonstrates superior performance in injecting both new and existing knowledge. The research used innovative datasets and assessment methods to ensure the practicality and viability of the theoretical findings.
