#### Background
- **Background**
This article introduces the massive amount of user-generated microblogs on platforms like Twitter, which are difficult for users to comprehend. Hashtags are used to convey central ideas and topics, increasing content visibility and attracting a wider audience. Mainstream hashtags, being the most prevalent and semantically accurate, face challenges in understanding new microblog content and accurately identifying mainstream tags.

- **Existing Work**
The article mentions two research paths for these challenges: retrieval-based methods, which mitigate the second problem by retrieving from a fixed predefined mainstream hashtag list but fail to comprehend continuously updated information, and generation-based methods, which understand new tweets well but are limited in identifying mainstream tags without additional features.

#### Core Contributions
  - **RIGHT Framework**
      - **Challenge 1: How to understand new tweets while accurately identifying mainstream hashtags**
        The proposed RIGHT framework leverages retrieval-augmented technology to combine retrieval and generation methods, addressing this challenge. It includes three parts: a retriever that finds relevant tags from the entire tweet-tag set, a selector that enhances mainstream tag identification by introducing global signals, and a generator that combines the input tweet and selected tags to directly generate the needed tags.

      - **Challenge 2: How to reduce costs for retrieval and the selector while ensuring the quality of retrieved information**
        By incorporating multi-dimensional features into the generator, such as the similarity between the input tweet and the retrieved tweet and its hashtags, as well as the frequency of the hashtags, the paper improves the selector's ability to identify mainstream hashtags, thus avoiding high-cost investment in the retriever and increasing the quality of the retrieved information.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The RIGHT framework was tested on two large-scale datasets (English Twitter (THG) and Chinese Weibo (WHG)), achieving significant improvements over the latest state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the framework was applied to ChatGPT using zero-shot instruction learning, resulting in a 12.7% improvement for THG and 18.3% for WHG.

#### Summary
The paper presents a new retrieval-augmented generative system for mainstream hashtag recommendation (RIGHT), combining the strengths of retrievers, selectors, and generators to overcome existing methods' limitations in processing new information and identifying mainstream tags, and demonstrates significant experimental results.
