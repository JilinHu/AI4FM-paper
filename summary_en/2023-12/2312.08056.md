#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the importance of ancient artifacts in cultural preservation and restoration. Technological developments in recent years have led to innovative artifact-related projects. However, there still remains a significant exploration to be done in the domain of artifact-related tasks, one of which is recreating visual images of artifacts from textual descriptions, as many physical artifacts are often damaged or have been lost, leaving behind only textual records.
- **Existing Work**
Despite significant advancements in open-domain text-to-image synthesis, existing approaches struggle to produce satisfying results in the specialized field of archaeological studies due to a lack of domain expertise. This results in errors in generated images such as incorrect shapes, patterns, and details that do not match the implicit knowledge in the text and historical context of the target artifact.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced knowledge-aware artifact image synthesis approach**
    - **Challenge 1: Noisiness and lack of well-presented knowledge information in text prompts**
      To tackle the issue of noisiness and poorly presented knowledge in the prompt, the paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to enhance text prompts. LLMs are used to extract core and meaningful information from a given text prompt and reorganize it in a more structured way. Additionally, LLMs serve as an external knowledge base to retrieve relevant archaeological information for enriching the restructured prompts.
    - **Challenge 2: Lack of textual and visual knowledge supervision in generation process**
      To address the lack of supervision, the paper introduces additional multimodal supervisions. A contrastive training paradigm is introduced for the text encoder so that textual representation of artifacts aligns well with archaeological knowledge, and stricter visual constraints are applied using edge and perceptual loss to align the final visual output with the visual domain knowledge of ancient artifacts.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The proposed method leverages a pretrained Chinese Stable Diffusion model as the core component, enhanced with LLM-aided prompt construction and multi-source supervision techniques. Through comparative experiments and user studies, the method substantially outperforms conventional text-to-image models and greatly enhances the generation quality of historical artifacts.

#### Summary
This paper proposes a knowledge-aware method for synthesizing images of ancient artifacts with LLM-enhanced prompting and multi-source supervision, overcoming the lack of domain knowledge in existing text-to-image synthesis methods and showing significant improvement in quality and historical knowledge alignment.
