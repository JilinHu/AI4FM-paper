#### Background
- **Background**
This paper discusses the current state of recommender systems, particularly the issue of information overload in the task of top-k recommendation. Additionally, the paper notes that while large language models (LLMs) have shown their applicability in various domains such as recommendation systems, and can act as rankers for pre-filtered recommendations, existing methods have not fully utilized the capabilities of LLMs, especially in integrating multiple ranking tasks to improve model performance and blending signals from traditional recommendation systems.
- **Existing Work**
Existing efforts typically use standard, general-purpose LLMs which do not inherently align with recommendation objectives. To address this issue, studies have proposed using instruction tuning techniques to align LLMs with specific recommendation tasks better. This approach outperforms traditional models, but there has not been an exhaustive study of the ranking task itself, nor has there been integration of signals from conventional recommendation models.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a framework named RecRanker**
  - **Challenge 1: How to utilize LLMs for more effective top-k recommendation**
      RecRanker uses adaptive user sampling methods to select high-quality users and proposes a position shifting strategy to alleviate position bias by instruction tuning the LLMs for better alignment with specific recommendation tasks.
  - **Challenge 2: How to integrate signals from traditional recommendation systems to improve the performance of LLMs**
      The framework incorporates information from traditional recommendation systems into the instructions, enabling the LLMs to understand the context better and reason about user preferences, playing a key role in improving model performance.

#### Implementation and Deployment
RecRanker, through adaptive user sampling and enhanced prompting techniques, includes three distinct ranking tasks: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise ranking, and introduces a hybrid ranking method to improve model performance. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RecRanker. Results show that RecRanker significantly outperforms baseline models in most cases, indicating its superiority.

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel framework named RecRanker, which optimizes the performance of LLMs in top-k recommendation tasks through instruction tuning and effectively integrates signals from traditional recommendation systems, improving the model's application performance in recommendation scenarios.
