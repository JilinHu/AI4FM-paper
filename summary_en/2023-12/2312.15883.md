#### Background
- **Background**
The paper explores how the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly influenced task performance in the field of Natural Language Processing. It focuses on two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning (FT), and proposes the Hypothesis Knowledge Graph Enhanced (HyKGE) framework to enhance medical LLMs using a knowledge graph.

- **Existing Work**
Current work, while using retrieval augmentation to reduce factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks, still faces challenges including the difficulty in avoiding factual inaccuracies (hallucinations), outdated knowledge, and a lack of expertise in specific domains or highly specialized queries. Especially in fields where reliability and trustworthiness are essential, such as law, medicine, and science, these issues undermine the reliability of LLMs. How to align user inputs with high-quality structured knowledge while reducing interaction with LLMs and filtering out noise in retrieved information remains unresolved.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced the HyKGE framework**
  - **Challenge 1: Unclear user query expressions and excessive noise**
    The existing problem is how to effectively align user inputs with high-quality structured knowledge, and reduce redundancy in interactions with LLMs. The HyKGE framework leverages the zero-shot capabilities and rich knowledge of LLMs to compensate for the incompleteness of user queries. It uses hypothetical document outputs to explore and pinpoint accurate, reliable LLM response directions, identifies corresponding anchor points on the knowledge graph to direct exploration and pruning, and corrects incorrect and illogical responses in hypothetical outputs to avoid hallucinations.

  - **Challenge 2: Expensive time overhead and cumulative errors in interactions**
    The existing methods may incur excessive time overhead and accumulate errors in the distributed reasoning process due to multiple interactions with LLMs. The HyKGE framework proposes a fragment reranking module that uses multiple short snippets from the hypothesized outputs to reorganize and merge retrieved knowledge. This ensures fine-grained interaction and filtering, while addressing the issue of imprecise matching between long (hypothesized documents) and short (knowledge inference paths) text.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The HyKGE framework was evaluated using real-world datasets and showed superiority, especially in providing accurate knowledge with clear confidence in complex and difficult scenarios. By incorporating the zero-shot capabilities of large language models, HyKGE transformed incomplete user queries into exploratory hypothesis outputs, aligning them with anchor points on the knowledge graph, reducing the number of interactions with LLMs, and increasing efficiency. Additionally, by reranking fragments, HyKGE improved the alignment between user queries and external knowledge inference paths to achieve precise interaction and filtering.

#### Summary
The HyKGE framework effectively addresses the accuracy and interpretability challenges faced by large language models in dealing with complex problems in the medical field, demonstrating potential for applications in the medical domain and showcasing its superiority in real-world scenarios.
