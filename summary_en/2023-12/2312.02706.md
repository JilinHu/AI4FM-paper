#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as major carriers of world knowledge and their pre-training in neural networks. It emphasizes issues with LLMs despite their extensive pre-training with sequence-based world knowledge.

- **Existing Work**
Existing symbolic knowledge like Knowledge Graphs (KGs) could enhance the LLMs, but these models still lack in structuring and managing the knowledge representations of the world. Unlike traditional symbolic AI systems like expert systems where components like the knowledge base and reasoning engines were built as independent modules, modern LLMs mix "Language" and "Knowledge," which deviates from the conventional symbolic systems. Additionally, the way large models currently store knowledge lacks recognizable patterns, making it hard for the model to make connections in parameter space and generate answers close to human cognition.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a concept of Large Knowledge Model (LKM)**
    - **Challenge 1: Transitioning from Large Language Models to Large Knowledge Models**
      The paper advocates for the development of an LKM, engineered to better manage and decode the diverse structures of knowledge representation. It points out future large models should decouple the world model from the inference mechanism to allow the stored knowledge to be independently verified and maintained.

    - **Challenge 2: Restructuring Pretraining with Structural Knowledge**
      It proposes enhancing the structural features of the training corpus during the pretraining phase to reduce the "cognitive gap" between large models and human thinking. By improving the organization of data, the knowledge in large models can become more transparent, associative, and verifiable.

- **Challenge 3: Large Commonsense Model**
    Current LLMs have shown potential in storing vast commonsense knowledge and conducting commonsense reasoning. However, they face challenges such as hallucination and unreliable reasoning results. The researchers see the potential to create an extensive large commonsense knowledge model by integrating traditional commonsense knowledge bases with LLMs. Such a model would combine the strengths of both approaches to overcome their individual limitations.

- **Challenge 4: The Five "A" Principles of LKM**
    The article concludes with introducing a new concept of an LKM and its pivotal characteristics. It uses a five "A" framework to outline the essential aspects of an LKM, including Augmented Pretraining, Authentic Knowledge, Accountable Reasoning, Abundant Coverage, and Alignment with Knowledge Structures.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The article does not provide specific details of implementation and deployment, nor does it offer any empirical assessment results or contrast with related work. The primary content is theoretical analysis and conceptual propositions without details on technical execution and experimental evaluation.

#### Summary
The paper proposes the concept of a Large Knowledge Model (LKM), aimed at more effectively managing and interpreting the diversity of knowledge representation. The study outlines the challenges in transitioning from current LLMs to LKMs, underlines the importance of structured knowledge in pre-training, and introduces a set of design principles for LKMs.
