#### Background
- **Background**
LLMs have shown their capabilities in natural language interactions and understanding complex queries, triggering the use of LLMs across various domains. However, the incorporation of LLMs within databases is still an open question, especially considering the privacy and specificity of tasks in the database domain.

- **Existing Work**
Most existing works have implemented a direct approach by providing common LLMs such as GPT-4 with instructions via few-shot prompting or in-context learning. While easy to adapt, this can result in sub-optimal performance compared to fine-tuned LLMs. The intelligent interaction with databases utilizing agents has been explored, but privacy-sensitive setups for LLM-augmented database interactions have been under-investigated. 

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced DB-GPT**
      - **Challenge 1: Privacy protection and intuitive database operations using LLMs**
      DB-GPT incorporates private LLM technology fine-tuned on domain-specific corpora. It offers a novel retrieval augmented generation (RAG) knowledge system and an adaptive learning mechanism for performance improvement based on user feedback. Additionally, it uses a service-oriented multi-model framework (SMMF) with powerful data-driven agents.
      
      - **Challenge 2: Enhancing LLMs' capacity to manage context information, reason, and perceive**
      DB-GPT’s system involves a multi-source RAG for QA, which includes phases for knowledge construction, retrieval, and adaptive in-contextual learning (ICL). This process enriches the LLM's capacity for understanding context and reasoning.

#### Implementation and Deployment
DB-GPT’s performance and efficiency have been validated through evaluations such as Text-to-SQL and KBQA, as well as case studies and user surveys, where it was found to outperform competitors on most dimensions. The system is designed with a multi-source RAG for QA, service-oriented multi-model framework (SMMF) for deployment, multiple agent strategies for different roles, and DB plugins for enhancing interaction with databases.

#### Summary
This paper presents DB-GPT, an innovation integrating LLMs and database systems to enhance user experience and accessibility, demonstrating a hierarchical design that effectively addresses concerns such as privacy and security protection, while also elevating the system's overall performance and efficiency through multi-source RAG and adaptive ICL mechanisms.
