#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ability to interpret input strings as instructions to carry out tasks. LLMs are being deployed in areas such as writing assistance, but they have shortcomings such as poor reasoning abilities, lack of reliability, and sensitivity to prompt phrasing. Efforts have been made to find the optimal phrasing for prompts, and this process is found to be automatable and effective with model guidance or feedback.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work has attempted to address LLMs' issues through optimal prompt phrasing but mathematical modeling of LLM behavior is challenging because of LLMs' sensitivity to input, opaque design, random outputs, and their various downstream applications with task-specific prompts. This necessitates a modeling language that can account for the model's complexity and adaptability.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a theoretical framework based on category theory**
    - **Challenge 1: How to generalize and describe automated prompting methods**
        Category theory, a branch of mathematics studying analogies between different mathematical concepts, was used to model both prompting approaches and task-specific behavior of a fixed LLM. The paper generalizes automated prompting approaches as meta-prompting, showing them as task-agnostic processes that model language and user interaction without depending on the task.
    - **Challenge 2: Proving that meta-prompting methods are more effective than fixed prompts in generating desired outputs**
        The experiments conducted within the paper utilised meta-prompting in the active areas of creativity and ideation. User preference for the prompts generated through meta-prompting and their corresponding outputs was significantly higher than baseline prompts (p < 0.01), leading to the conclusion that meta-prompting is generally more effective than fixed prompts.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments were conducted with a basic meta-prompt applied to ideation and creativity. Ideation involves suggesting ideas to improve a passage, while creativity is about suggesting how to continue writing it. The study found that prompts generated through meta-prompting were more preferred by users than baseline prompts (p < 0.01), and the resulting outputs from these prompts were ranked as more suitable (p < 0.01), indicating the effectiveness of meta-prompting over traditional fixed prompts.

#### Summary
This paper presents a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and depict automated prompting methods. Through experiments in the fields of ideation and creativity, it demonstrates that meta-prompting generates outputs that are more favorable to users compared to traditional fixed prompts.
