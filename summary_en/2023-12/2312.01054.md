#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) concerning their spatial reasoning abilities, particularly in dealing with numerical trajectory data. Despite LLMs showcasing significant aptitude in sequence modeling and general pattern recognition, their broader spatial reasoning capabilities, especially when applied to numerical trajectory data, remain underexplored.

- **Existing Work**
Previous research has indicated that LLMs can improve and complete low-level robotic action sequences or repetitive motions like a sinusoid. However, labeling an entire sequence, which demands long-form context retention, semantic comprehension to associate a sequence with its textual annotation, and generalization to complex, non-repetitive patterns, has not been addressed. Existing work has either evaluated shorter sequences, excluded higher-dimensional analysis, or used additional token embedding models. In general, LLMs have shown significantly poor performance in spatial reasoning abilities. This paper extends the work by tackling the underexplored problem of LLMs' inherent performance on higher-dimensional trajectory identification.

  - **Challenge 1: Spatial Reasoning Abilities**
      The research investigates the ability of out-of-the-box LLMs to identify simple spatial patterns (such as circles or straightforward directions) and explores whether LLMs struggle with more complex spatial patterns, such as irregular 3D trajectories. Additionally, it examines whether there is knowledge transfer from simpler spatial tasks to more complex ones that can impact overall performance.

  - **Challenge 2: Understanding Data Types**
      The study focuses on directly understanding continuous sequences of 3D points, which remains an open problem concerning zero-shot understanding at the control level (e.g., trajectories). Previous works either used vision models or vision-language models to integrate visual embeddings, or appended a finite number of 3D object positions acquired by detection models in the prompts. However, this paper distinguishes itself by concentrating on understanding continuous sequences of 3D points on the prompting side.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper introduced a novel prefix-based prompting mechanism, leading to a 33% improvement on 3D trajectory data and up to a 10% increase over zero-shot prompting on SpartQA tasks. The results provide an intriguing glimpse into how LLMs engage with numerical and spatial information, establishing a solid foundation for identifying areas for future enhancements. The research suggests gains for other prompt types, such as In-context Learning and Chain-of-Thought, when utilizing the new prefix-prompting approach.

#### Summary
The paper advances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in spatial reasoning and sequence labeling, proposing a method to improve LLMs' performance in 3D trajectory recognition tasks with significant performance improvements.
