#### Background
- **Background**
Recent research has significantly advanced the application of alignment techniques to improve the helpfulness and harmlessness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in accordance with human intentions. This paper argues for the importance of alignment for honesty, ensuring LLMs proactively refuse to answer questions when they lack knowledge, without being overly conservative.
- **Existing Work**
Existing work predominantly focuses on enhancing LLMs' helpfulness by constructing extensive high-quality instruction-following datasets. There is also research on safety annotations to prevent LLMs from responding to harmful requests and generating unsafe content. However, research on alignment for honesty is limited, lacking a systematic framework to differentiate between what is known and unknown to the model.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced the concept of Alignment for Honesty**
      - **Challenge 1: "I don't know (idk) response"**
        The paper formalizes the problem by introducing the concept of an "idk response" to signify when a model explicitly refuses to answer a given question. These responses contain explicit "idk signs," indicating the challenges in discerning the LLM's knowledge limits for alignment of honesty.
      - **Challenge 2: Precise distinction between model and world knowledge**
        The paper deals with the distinction between model knowledge and world knowledge, which complicates the assessment of honesty. The paper assumes model knowledge largely coincides with world knowledge, thus treating them as the same for the study.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper proposes several straightforward yet effective honesty-oriented supervised fine-tuning methods, as prompts alone are inadequate. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility and general applicability of the proposed methods across various knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks. It also establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing not only domain-specific assessments but also generalization analyses based on specially constructed data and alignment tax analyses.

#### Summary
The paper introduces the concept of alignment for honesty in LLMs and presents challenges and proposed solutions. By formally defining the problem, suggesting new methods, and establishing an evaluation framework, the paper provides a comprehensive solution to alignment for honesty in large language models.
