#### Background
- **Background**     
The paper explores the field of combining machine vision and natural language processing, focusing specifically on a task known as Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), which aims to identify and generate masks for objects in an image based on language descriptions. Although RES has the potential for widespread application in various fields, traditional RES approaches have limitations as they are only capable of single-target scenarios and often neglect the cases of non-existent targets mentioned in descriptions.

- **Existing Work**
Existing methods like LISA are considered unable to perform well on the GRES task because they cannot adequately handle cases of multiple targets or empty targets.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a method named GSVA**
  - **Challenge 1: Multiple Targets**
    Current MLLMs face the challenge of handling multiple and empty targets. GSVA addresses the multi-target issue by predicting multiple [SEG] tokens to support multiple mask references simultaneously.
  - **Challenge 2: Empty Targets**
    Traditional models are compelled to produce incorrect masks when targets mentioned in user descriptions do not exist in the image. GSVA resolves this challenge by innovatively predicting [REJ] tokens to explicitly reject null targets.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Extensive experiments have demonstrated GSVA's efficacy in addressing the GRES problem. On the GRES benchmark gRefCOCO dataset, GSVA significantly outperforms LISA and prior state-of-the-art methods, setting new records with over 70% gIoU and cIoU. It has also proven competitive in classic RES and Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) tasks, achieving nearly 80% cIoU in RES tasks and 90% Prec@0.5 in REC tasks.

#### Summary
The GSVA method proposed in the paper solves the challenges of multi-target and empty targets in GRES tasks by learning to predict multiple [SEG] tokens and innovatively generating [REJ] tokens, demonstrating significant advantages over existing technologies.
