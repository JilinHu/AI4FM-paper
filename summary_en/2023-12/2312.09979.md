#### Background
- **Background**
The paper indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit tremendous capabilities in various tasks once they are supervised fine-tuned (SFT) to align with human instructions. Typically, such finetuning involves increasing a considerable amount of instruction data to cater to more task types or to significantly enhance the performance of a specific task.

- **Existing Work**
However, the authors find that augmenting instruction data on a large scale can interfere with the world knowledge previously stored in the LLMs, a phenomenon they termed "world knowledge forgetting".

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced LoRAMoE**
    - **Challenge 1: How to maintain the integrity of the world knowledge in language models against the disruption from large-scale increases in fine-tuning data**
        The study introduced LoRAMoE, a plugin version of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, to tackle this problem. During the training phase, the backbone model is frozen to ensure the integrity of stored world knowledge. They propose the use of localized balancing constraints to coordinate task utilization among parts of experts while enabling other experts to fully leverage the world knowledge stored in the models.

    - **Challenge 2: Ensuring the model performs well in multi-task learning**
        LoRAMoE does not lead to knowledge forgetting during fine-tuning and can reasonably coordinate experts based on data type during inference. Experimental results show that LoRAMoE is capable of preventing the disruption of world knowledge in language models due to large-scale fine-tuning and suggests potential in multi-task learning.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper does not provide detailed implementation and deployment information, but mentions that experimental results demonstrate that LoRAMoE can effectively maintain the integrity of world knowledge in language models under large-scale fine-tuning. Moreover, its effectiveness in capability localization is confirmed through visualization approaches. LoRAMoE also delivers additional benefits in terms of performance on downstream tasks.

#### Summary
The paper introduces a model called LoRAMoE to address the problem of world knowledge forgetting in language models due to massive increases in fine-tuning data and shows potential in multi-task learning.
