#### Background
- **Background**
This paper emphasizes the importance of enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing and understanding extensive text sequences, a critical aspect in applications requiring deep comprehension and synthesis of large volumes of information. Current LLMs, primarily built on Transformer architecture, face challenges in extending the context window due to the quadratic time and memory complexity issues associated with full attention mechanisms.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work using full attention mechanisms fails to efficiently extend the context window, as it may reduce training and inference efficiency. Moreover, attention computation over extremely long sequences might lead to evenly distributed attention and the omission of vital information, with an imbalanced distribution of training signals for long and short sequences.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a new model architecture, Zebra**
      - **Challenge 1: How to improve efficiency in processing long text sequences?**
        Addressing the complexity issues caused by the full attention mechanism of Transformers, the paper proposes managing this complexity with grouped local-global attention layers, substantially reducing computational requirements and memory consumption. The Zebra model alternates local and global attention layers (akin to a zebra's stripes), achieving equivalent performance levels with merely half of the computational effort required for training compared to a global attention Transformer.

      - **Challenge 2: How to maintain performance for both long and short sequences?**
        To address the performance discrepancy on long and short sequences, the study conducts a comprehensive set of experiments, including pretraining from scratch, long context adaptation training, and extensive instruction tuning. The results indicate that Zebra achieves comparable or superior performance on both short and long sequence benchmarks.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The Zebra model underwent various verification experiments, including pretraining from scratch, continuation of training the Llama-2-7B model through long-context adaptation training, and fine-tuning using a mix of long and short instruction-tuning datasets followed by systematic performance evaluation. These experiments not only demonstrated that Zebra is on par with Llama-2-7B on short sequence benchmarks but also excelled in longer sequences, showcasing superior perplexity results and generalized better performance across different benchmark tests.

#### Summary
The Zebra model proposed in this paper effectively lowers computational and memory requirements by utilizing grouped local-global attention layers, exhibiting excellent performance in processing both long and short sequences. The research team validated the model through various experiments, proving the advantages of the Zebra architecture.
