#### Background
- **Background**
The paper highlights the significant changes brought about by large language models (LLMs), especially through LLM-driven autonomous agents across various domains. These agents can seamlessly collaborate, splitting tasks and enhancing accuracy, thus minimizing human involvement. However, these agents often approach a wide range of tasks in isolation, failing to benefit from past experiences. This isolation can lead to repeating mistakes and inefficient task-solving attempts.
- **Existing Work**
Existing multi-step interactions among autonomous agents often neglect the accumulation of experience from past tasks, leading to repetitive errors or unnecessary trial-and-error processes in similar future tasks.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a novel framework named Experiential Co-Learning.**
  - **Challenge 1: Introduced a Co-Tracking module**
      The module was designed to establish collaborative rehearsals amongst an instructor and an assistant, focusing on tracking their joint 'procedural trajectories.' The challenge lay in ensuring efficient recording and showcasing of strategies employed during task completion. The framework defined a formal task execution chain representing the collaborative dynamics throughout the task.    
  - **Challenge 2: Introduced a Co-Memorizing module**
      The module aims to efficiently discover non-adjacent 'shortcuts' from these trajectories, integrating them into their collective experience pools. The challenge was to select and maintain useful experiences to prevent agents from progressing along incorrect paths or taking ineffective steps when communicating with each other. The approach does this by transforming task execution sequences into graphs, and using external feedback signals to assess the value of each node.
  - **Challenge 3: Introduced a Co-Reasoning module**
      This module aims to combine the collective experience pools of agents to enable advanced interaction through instructions and responses. The challenge was in ensuring that the agents could use their own experiences to precisely and efficiently collaborate in solving unseen tasks. The framework uses retrieval tools and few-shot reasoning to enable agents to jointly enhance their task-solving abilities.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The research team conducted a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of the proposed method across multiple dimensions including autonomy, efficiency, effectiveness, and sensitivity. Different types of LLM-driven software development paradigms, both single-agent and two-agent methods, were chosen as baselines, and tests were conducted based on the NLDD dataset. Evaluation metrics included completeness, executability, and consistency, which were then combined into an overarching metric. The results demonstrated superior performance across all dimensions when compared to existing methods, with a higher autonomy index, indicating higher quality software generation with less need for manual intervention.

#### Summary
The paper proposes a new framework named Experiential Co-Learning, which through the sequential implementation of co-tracking, co-memorizing, and co-reasoning modules, allows LLM-driven intelligent agents to learn more effectively from historical trajectories and use past experiences to reason mutually when solving new tasks. It shows a clear performance improvement over existing technologies.
