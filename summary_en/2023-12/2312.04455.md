#### Background
- **Background**
      The paper addresses an issue with Large Language Models (LLMs) in tool usage performance. The authors identify that the attention allocation waveform pattern impacts tool use and that performance decreases when essential information falls into the trough zones of this waveform.

- **Existing Work**
      Existing LLM-based tool usage frameworks have shown some success but have varied levels of context awareness across different context positions, which may affect their performance in tool usage tasks. The issue arises especially when key information aligns with the troughs of the attention waveform, causing the models to potentially overlook critical details, leading to lower accuracy.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a new inference method called Attention Buckets**
      - **Challenge 1: Information omission in the waveform pattern**
          The research introduces parallel processing of context with each process characterized by a unique Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) angle basis forming varied attention waveforms. By interleaving attention wave peaks from different executions, it compensates for the troughs of a particular process, reducing the risk of the LLM missing essential information.

      - **Challenge 2: Enhancing context awareness**
          By interleaving different attention wave peaks, the LLM focuses on various positions within the context in each run, giving a more comprehensive understanding. The outputs from these parallel executions are aggregated to compute a weighted sum which is then decoded to produce the final prediction token, thus enhancing the model's context awareness.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The extensive experiments showcased in the paper demonstrate how an open-source model with 7B parameters, when enhanced by Attention Buckets, achieves state-of-the-art performance comparable to GPT-4 on the widely recognized tool use benchmark, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.

#### Summary
The paper presents the Attention Buckets method to address deficiencies in context awareness of LLMs during tool use, significantly enhancing their performance in such tasks by processing different RoPE angle bases.
