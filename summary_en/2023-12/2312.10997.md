#### Background
- **Background**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a significant approach to improving the retrieval and generative performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the advent of models like ChatGPT, RAG began gaining increasing attention.

- **Existing Work**
Although previous research covers many aspects of LLMs, they lack systematic understanding and improvement of the quality of the generative predictions, especially combining retrieval to reduce incorrect generations (i.e., hallucinations) and enhance the reliability of predictions.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Challenge 1: Enhancing retrieval and generative quality**
      This survey comprehensively discusses research paradigms in the RAG domain, especially on improving information extraction and utilization during the retrieval-augmented generation process. The paper presents three main RAG paradigms: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG, systematizing the three core components: Retrieval, Augmentation, and Generation, highlighting the improvement directions and current technological characteristics of RAG. This work supplements existing studies, offering readers a comprehensive and systematic understanding of key technologies in large models and retrieval-augmented generation.

  - **Challenge 2: Sources and processes of augmentation data**
      The paper also organizes current work regarding augmentation methods, covering three aspects of the augmentation stages of RAG, augmentation data sources, and augmentation processes. Additionally, it summarizes the evaluation system suitable for RAG, practical scenarios, and other pertinent content. Thus, the paper equips readers with the capacity to explore current typical application cases in practice.

#### Implementation and Deployment
This study conducted a comprehensive survey of research approaches and technological developments in the RAG field without specific implementation and deployment results. It provides a summary of the existing research findings and discusses future trends of RAG. The survey summarizes various augmentation methods, evaluation systems, and future directions, enabling readers to better understand and apply RAG technologies.

#### Summary
The paper offers a thorough and systematic overview of the RAG domain, emphasizing the importance of enhancing the retrieval and generative capabilities of LLMs, highlighting current challenges, and envisioning future research directions.
