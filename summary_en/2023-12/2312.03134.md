#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses the challenges faced in deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly highlighting the high hardware demand and cost of models like GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters, which limits the widespread adoption of LLMs and prompts computer architects to design more cost-effective hardware.

- **Existing Work**
The paper notes that existing tools do not meet the needs for hardware design evaluation. For instance, Roofline model analysis is fast but not precise, and cycle-level simulators are precise but slow. FPGA emulation provides accurate results and area statistics but requires substantial engineering effort. Hence, a new hardware evaluation tool is required in the era of LLMs.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced the LLMCompass hardware evaluation framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Lack of tools to evaluate hardware designs**
        Existing design evaluation tools do not offer comparison before writing RTL code. LLMCompass provides a general hardware description template that allows for faster, more accurate assessment for different design choices.

    - **Challenge 2: Lack of understanding of how hardware design choices impact LLM performance**
        LLMCompass utilizes a mapper to manually manage the memory hierarchy and find the performance-optimal mapping and scheduling scheme, optimizing how hardware design choices affect LLM inference performance.

#### Implementation and Deployment
LLMCompass uses a mapper to automatically find the performance-optimal mapping and scheduling and includes an area-based cost model to help designers evaluate different design choices. The paper validates the accuracy of LLMCompass on three commercial hardware designs: NVIDIA A100, AMD MI210, and Google TPUv3. Compared to real-world hardware, LLMCompass's estimated latency has an average error rate of 10.4% across various operators with various input sizes, and an average error rate of 4.1% for LLM inference. LLMCompass is also fast, requiring only 15-16 minutes to simulate a 4-NVIDIA A100 GPU node running a GPT-3 175B inference, including 26400 rounds of the mapper's parameter search.

#### Summary
LLMCompass, as a hardware evaluation framework, effectively addresses the challenges in designing hardware for LLM inference. It is not only fast and accurate but also architecturally descriptive and cost-aware, and it has been validated on commercial hardware with exceptional performance.
