#### Background
- **Background**
The paper notes that quantities in a text are essential components that precisely characterize the magnitude of entities, and they provide an accurate perspective for natural language understanding, especially in reasoning tasks. Yet, most reasoning task research based on large language models (LLMs) focuses on numerical values and overlooks the dimensional concept of quantities with units despite its importance.

- **Existing Work**
Due to the lack of knowledge about dimensions and related quantitative benchmarks, LLMs have been underperforming when processing and understanding quantities, limiting their performance on quantitative reasoning tasks.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced Dimension Perception Enhancement Model**
    - **Challenge 1: Insufficient Perception of Value and Unit Dimensions**
      The paper addresses this issue by constructing a Dimensional Unit Knowledge Base (DimUnitKB) and proposing a benchmark (DimEval) with seven tasks across three categories to probe and enhance the dimension perception skills of LLMs.
    - **Challenge 2: Lack of Effective Evaluation for Quantitative Reasoning**
      To evaluate the effectiveness of their methods, the paper designed a quantitative reasoning task and conducted experiments. The results show that using the dimension perception method significantly improves accuracy (from 43.55% to 50.67%) on quantitative reasoning tasks compared to GPT-4.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The researchers established DimUnitKB for storing and understanding different units of physical quantities, then designed the DimEval benchmark to evaluate and enhance the dimension perception skills of LLMs in aspects such as basic perception, dimension perception, and scale perception. The model's effectiveness was validated through experimentation, indicating that using the dimension perception method achieves higher accuracy on quantitative reasoning tasksâ€”improving from an accuracy of 43.55% to 50.67%, outperforming GPT-4.

#### Summary
This research has significantly improved LLMs' quantitative reasoning abilities by establishing a dimensional unit knowledge base and a customized benchmark test, providing a new pathway for understanding and reasoning accurately with vital quantitative information in text.
