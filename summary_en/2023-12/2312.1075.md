#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper discusses the increasing popularity of neural machine translation (NMT) and LLMs represented by ChatGPT, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of their distinct characteristics and relationships, which is essential for language professionals and researchers to make informed decisions about these emerging translation technologies.

- **Existing Work**
The existing studies show that ChatGPT can rival or even surpass advanced NMT engines like Google Translate and DeepL in terms of automated metrics and human evaluation, capable of producing natural, fluent, and human-like translations. However, the research has not yet deeply explored the linguistic and stylistic features that can differentiate translations produced by ChatGPT from NMT and human translation (HT), nor the degree of resemblance among these different types of translation.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a multi-feature methodology**
    - **Challenge 1: Distinguish the translations generated by ChatGPT, NMT, and HT**
        The study employs statistical testing, machine learning algorithms, and multidimensional analysis (MDA) to analyze a wide range of linguistic features in translation texts. Supervised classifiers show high accuracy in distinguishing between the three types of translations, while unsupervised clustering techniques did not yield satisfactory results.

    - **Challenge 2: Discovering that the translations produced by ChatGPT are more similar to NMT than to HT**
        Findings from MDA dimensions are complemented by distance calculations and visualizations, showing that, in most MDA dimensions, the translations produced by ChatGPT are more similar to NMT than to HT.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The research constructed a customized corpus consisting of English translations of Spokesperson's Remarks on important domestic and foreign affairs. A multi-feature approach was employed by examining a group of relevant features at lexical, syntactic, and textual levels simultaneously. Additionally, to address the third research question, the research used distance calculation and dimension-reduced visualization techniques to reveal the similarities among the three types of translations as measured by linguistic features.

#### Summary
The study provides tentative answers to the possibility of ChatGPT being an alternative translation tool apart from NMT and showcases its distinctive properties compared to NMT and HT. These novel insights may inform the future development of more human-like and contextually appropriate translation systems and offer guidance on how to effectively use AI-generated translations.
