#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper discusses significant advances made in complex reasoning tasks by Large Language Models (LLMs), especially the development of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. However, despite progress, these models' reasoning capabilities are still constrained due to their intrinsic understanding, lacking external insights.

- **Existing Work**
Existing methods such as CoT and self-correction strategies based solely on the model's internal understanding and perspective of the question do not overcome the fundamental issue of models performing poorly on reasoning tasks. Moreover, models struggle to revise their responses without external feedback, which is mainly because they rely entirely on internal representations to generate responses, making it hard to overcome inherent limitations in capability.

#### Core Contributions
- **Exchange-of-Thought (EoT) framework proposed**
    - **Challenge 1: Enhancing reasoning capabilities and overcoming limitations in intrinsic understanding**
         The EoT framework allows for cross-model communication, enabling models to incorporate the thoughts of others while solving problems, thus providing external insights. Inspired by network topology and agent communication, EoT introduced four communication paradigms: Memory, Report, Relay, and Debate, to enrich problem-solving processes with diverse insights.
    - **Challenge 2: Balancing the risk of correct and incorrect reasoning chain propagation**
         To balance the risks of propagating correct and incorrect reasoning chains, EoT implemented a robust confidence evaluation mechanism that assesses model certainty through variability of answers, mitigating the impact of incorrect reasoning.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments on various complex reasoning tasks show that EoT significantly outperforms established baselines in enhancing the performance of LLMs. EoT utilizes four communication paradigms alongside a confidence evaluation mechanism. The results confirm that EoT significantly boosts model performance in complex reasoning tasks and underscores the importance and cost-effectiveness of incorporating external insights and communication in problem-solving.

#### Summary
The Exchange-of-Thought (EoT) framework introduced in this paper enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through cross-model communication, leveraging four communication paradigms and a confidence evaluation mechanism, yielding significant improvements in various reasoning tasks and proving the role of external insights in enhancing model performance.
