#### Background
- **Background**
The paper introduces the ProTIP framework, aimed at enhancing the capability of Tool Retrieval (TR) and planning tasks. The research focuses on how to support planning tasks with tool retrieval, particularly on how to effectively execute all subtasks within a complex request.

- **Existing Work**
Existing approaches use text-based and vector-based search baselines for tool retrieval and rely on Task Decomposition (TD) for planning. However, these methods have limitations, such as not fully utilizing execution history, requiring large pre-trained language models or costly annotations to generate high-quality rewrites, and not ensuring an alignment between the subtasks and the functionalities of the tools.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced ProTIP**
      - **Challenge 1: How to achieve more effective tool retrieval**
      ProTIP introduces a progressive retrieval method that overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches by iteratively retrieving the top-k tools specific to each subtask, conditioned on execution history, retaining the order of subtasks, and improving the retrieval efficacy to handle more complex queries.

  - **Challenge 2: How to improve planning performance and reduce tool hallucination**
      By fine-tuning the OpenLLaMA-7B-v2 model, ProTIP aims to predict the next API to execute in a multi-step planning task. The method considers historical information, thus significantly increasing Tool Accuracy (TA) and reducing Tool Hallucination. Its performance in the prompt setting that includes both history and tool information ([T+H]) outperforms other baseline methods.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Using ProTIP and revised models, the authors evaluated the performance of tool retrieval and planning tasks. Experimental results show that ProTIP achieved an approximate 15.79% absolute improvement in Recall@10 compared to Task Decomposition-based Semantic Search (TD-SS), while also showing a 10.61% increase in Tool Accuracy and a 0.26% decrease in Tool Hallucination. The study also found that incorporating history from previous steps in planning tasks could significantly improve performance. The research highlights the importance of history in achieving higher tool accuracy but also encounters input truncation issues due to the length of the history.

#### Summary
The paper presents ProTIP, an advanced strategy for tool retrieval and use in complex planning tasks for large language models. The key to ProTIP lies in its progressive retrieval, effective use of execution history, and achieving subtask-tool functionality alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that ProTIP significantly outperforms traditional methods, reduces tool hallucination, and increases planning efficiency.
