#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the potential of language models (LLMs) to leverage code-writing to enhance reasoning capabilities, especially for a mix of logic, arithmetic, and semantic tasks. It proposes that LLMs can produce effective solutions by writing code and emulating code execution, particularly in scenarios where it is challenging to encode certain semantic tasks into executable code.
- **Existing Work**
Existing work assumes the intermediate reasoning steps (expressed in lines of code) written by LLMs need to be executable. However, the difficulty lies in representing many semantic tasks in code, which is often difficult or nearly impossible. Combining coding and language reasoning to get the best of both is a problem that remains unsolved by existing research.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a method called Chain of Code (CoC)**
    - **Challenge 1: Code-structuring of semantic tasks**
      Existing technologies struggle to translate complex semantic tasks into executable code because these problems often involve boundary cases difficult to tackle with programming logic. CoC encourages LLMs to format semantic sub-tasks as flexible pseudocode, allowing the code interpreter to explicitly catch undefined behaviors and hand them off to LLMs for emulation, filling a technical gap with the so-called "LMulator" (a portmanteau of LM and emulator).

    - **Challenge 2: Expanding the reasoning scope of LLMs**
      CoC enhances the performance of both large and small scale LLMs in tackling logic, arithmetic, and mixed semantic reasoning problems, expanding the types of questions LLMs can answer correctly. The ability to "think in code" allows LLMs to not only write executable precise algorithms but also generate outputs for semantic problems.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper validated CoC's performance across various benchmarks, especially on the BIG-Bench Hard tasks, where CoC achieved a high performance of 84%, marking a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought, setting a new industry standard. Experiments further show that the execution of the code interpreter and language model execution simulation are crucial for CoC's performance and that the method is compatible with both large and small models. Additionally, CoC demonstrated its merits as a general-purpose reasoner in a cross-task prompting benchmark.

#### Summary
Chain of Code (CoC) adds a new dimension to language models by improving reasoning capabilities through code writing and code execution emulation. It achieves breakthrough performance in both numerical and semantic reasoning tasks, expands the application scope of LLMs, and has the potential to be applied to a broader range of problems.
