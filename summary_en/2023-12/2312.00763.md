#### Background
- **Background**
The article described that large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots mainly rely on text-based interactions, imposing a substantial interactional cognitive load on users, especially for exploratory or sensemaking tasks like planning a trip or learning about a new city. Since the interaction is textual, users have little structural guidance and canâ€™t specify high-level preferences or goals. Thus, the paper proposed ExploreLLM, a system that allows users to structure their thoughts, explore options, navigate through choices and recommendations, and steer model responses to be more personalized.

- **Existing Work**
Despite advancements in prompt-based methods to unlock reasoning and planning abilities of LLMs, the interaction pattern between users and LLM-powered assistants remained largely unchanged. Moreover, current chatbots tend to deliver "average user" responses that prevent users from fully leveraging the AI assistance potential to complete their tasks due to a lack of personalization.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a new interaction mode with LLMs**
      - **Challenge 1: Structuring Complex Tasks** Traditional chatbots struggle with complex tasks, requiring high cognitive load from users. ExploreLLM introduces a tree-like data structure interaction model, which decomposes complex issues into a series of more manageable subtasks, presented via a graphical user interface (GUI) to alleviate mental strain, allowing users to structure their thoughts and receive more precise personalized responses.
  - **Challenge 2: Personalized Responses** Traditional chatbot responses are often too general and fail to meet specific user situations. ExploreLLM, by incorporating personal preferences functionality at each node, enables the system to consider these personalized contents to generate more personalized responses and options.

#### Implementation and Deployment
ExploreLLM was demonstrated through user studies to be helpful in providing structured task breakdown and personalization despite some usability issues. Compared to traditional text chatbots, users found the task structuring provided by ExploreLLM beneficial for planning and easier to personalize with their preferences. Additionally, users appreciated the sub-task list as a clear record of task status, providing a more glanceable alternative to long chat histories.

#### Summary
The paper introduced ExploreLLM, a new interaction pattern between users and LLM-powered assistants by combining a prompt-based task decomposition method with a novel schema-like GUI. The system aims to reduce the cognitive burden of completing complex tasks and to enhance the level of personalized responses.
