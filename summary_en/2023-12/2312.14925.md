#### Background
- **Background**
The article discusses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a variant of Reinforcement Learning (RL) that learns from human feedback rather than relying on an engineered reward function.

- **Existing Work**
The work is based on previous work in the related setting of Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) and notes that RLHF is at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Existing work has typically focused on specific models and applications, whereas this paper attempts to take a broader perspective on RLHF, exploring its core principles and main research trends across diverse applications and wide-ranging impact.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a comprehensive overview of RLHF**
    **Challenge 1: Understanding the intricate dynamics between algorithms and human feedback**
      The paper delves into methods of enhancing the performance and adaptability of intelligent systems under human guidance and aligning their objectives with human values.
    
    - **Challenge 2: Providing a comprehensive, multi-faceted overview of RLHF research**
      The article, by synthesizing the current landscape of RLHF research, aims to give researchers a comprehensive understanding of this rapidly growing field of research.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Although the paper itself does not detail specific implementations and deployments, it discusses various aspects of RLHF in detail, including the attributes, categories, and initializations of feedback; label collection; reward model training; and theoretical considerations such as policy learning and the comparison between preference-based and reward-based learning. It also covers RLHF applications and evaluation benchmarks, as well as supporting libraries and benchmarks.

#### Summary
This article is a survey of RLHF, analyzing its applications at the crossroads of artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction and discussing the latest research trends, especially those related to LLMs.
