#### Background
- **Background**
    The article discusses the challenges in coordinating multi-function calling by Large Language Models (LLMs). Current LLMs, such as ReAct, often require sequential reasoning and acting for each function call, resulting in high latency costs and sometimes inaccurate behavior.

- **Existing Work**
    Existing work like ReAct is inefficient in complex applications, especially when many function calls are required, because they execute each function call sequentially, reasoning about each observation before moving on to the next. This can lead to high latency and token consumption as the results of each step need to be concatenated before being passed back to the LLM for more reasoning.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a system called LLMCompiler**
    - **Challenge 1: High latency cost of large-scale function calling**
        LLMCompiler reduces the high latency cost of multi-function calling by introducing an LLM Planner, a Task Fetching Unit, and an Executor to parallelize the function calling process. This parallel execution reduces the time required for multi-function calling, lowers costs, and increases accuracy.

    - **Challenge 2: Smart planning and dependency management of tasks**
        LLMCompiler allows users to specify tools and optional in-context examples, and automatically computes an optimized orchestration of the function calls. It can manage tasks with complex dependencies and supports dynamic replanning based on intermediate results.

#### Implementation and Deployment
LLMCompiler is compatible with open-source models, such as LLaMA-2 and OpenAI's GPT models, and its code has been open-sourced. Benchmarked across a range of tasks showcasing different types of parallel function calling, including those requiring dynamic replanning, it demonstrates up to a 3.7× improvement in latency speeds, cost savings of up to 6.7×, and an accuracy improvement of about 9% compared to ReAct. Against OpenAI’s recent parallel function calling feature, LLMCompiler achieves up to a 1.35× latency gain while maintaining similar accuracy.

#### Summary
The paper introduces a system named LLMCompiler that addresses high latency costs and inefficiencies in executing multi-function calls by LLMs. It enhances speed, reduces costs, and improves accuracy through parallelized function calling and optimized orchestration.
