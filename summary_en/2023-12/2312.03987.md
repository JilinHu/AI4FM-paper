#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses entity resolution (ER), a key task in data cleaning and integration, with significant applications across domains like healthcare, finance, customer relationship management, law enforcement, and more.

- **Existing Work**
Existing solutions predominantly employ deep learning approaches using transformer-based models trained on extensive datasets with numerous labeled entity pairs. The main issue with these approaches is their monetary cost, as they require providing a task description and a set of demonstrations for each query, making it very expensive for large-scale ER tasks.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a Batch Prompting Framework named BATCHER**
    - **Challenge 1: Developing a cost-effective batch prompting method**
        The researchers introduce BATCHER, consisting of demonstration selection and question batching, and explore various design choices supporting batch prompting for ER. They specifically investigate how to select a batch of questions and a set of demonstrations that can cover all questions to optimally guide Large Language Models (LLMs) in providing answers.

    - **Challenge 2: Achieving an effective balance between matching accuracy and monetary cost**
        The team developed a covering-based demonstration selection strategy that selects the most representative demonstrations after determining a batch of questions, thus achieving an effective balance between matching accuracy and cost.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Through extensive experimentation, the researchers found that batch prompting is highly cost-effective for ER compared to PLM-based methods extensively fine-tuned with labeled data and LLM-based methods with manually designed prompting. The results also offer guidance on how to select the appropriate design options for batch prompting.

#### Summary
This paper delivers a comprehensive study aimed at exploring a cost-effective batch prompting approach to entity resolution. The main contributions include the introduction of the BATCHER framework and the proposal of a covering-based demonstration selection strategy.
