#### Background
- **Background**
Researchers face the challenge of keeping pace with the rapid development of AI fields like NLP, ML, and CV.

- **Existing Work**
Current academic reports may not cover recent trends fully, such as the practical application and evaluation of LLMs, as well as their interaction with visual modalities.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced an analysis report of the most cited papers on arXiv**
  - **Challenge 1: Understanding and evaluating trends in the AI field**
      By identifying the top-40 most cited papers on arXiv from January to September 2023 and analyzing their dataset characteristics and keyword popularity, the paper provides insights into recent AI developments.

  - **Challenge 2: Revealing participation differences across global regions in AI research**
      The paper examines the geographical distribution of the most influential papers to reveal the dominance of the US and China in both industry and academia, while Europe notably lags behind in the top most cited papers.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper analyzed papers from the beginning of 2023 to September on arXiv, using normalized citation counts to identify the most notable. The findings highlighted NLP research's focus on LLMs with a shift toward exploring a broader range of models, such as LLaMA and multimodal language models. The report also found the top-40 publications were mostly from a few institutions, prominently US companies, and pointed out a lag in European representation in the most cited papers.

#### Summary
The paper provides an analysis of the most current trends and influence in AI research by examining the most cited papers on arXiv over a set period, particularly highlighting the significance of LLMs in this context.
