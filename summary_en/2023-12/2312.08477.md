#### Background
- **Background**
The paper underscores the significance of static analysis in identifying software issues. Static analysis plays a crucial role in early detection of potential software defects. However, its application across a broader scope is hindered by the need for customization for different targets and complexity, which limits its use. Current static analysis tools require substantial human effort and are usually limited to specific target programs and programming languages.

- **Existing Work**
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama have shown potential in various software engineering tasks, but their application in complex static analysis, particularly in understanding intricate code structures, remains insufficient. These models often struggle with understanding complex code structures and may misinterpret code or produce inaccurate results, referred to as "hallucinations" of LLMs.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a novel approach named E&V (Execution and Verification)**
    - **Challenge 1: Enhancing accuracy in complex static analysis**
      The E&V approach utilizes LLMs to simulate pseudo-code execution, effectively conducting static analysis encoded within the pseudo-code with minimal human effort. Through this simulation, LLMs can conduct static analysis as if the code were running in a real environment. Moreover, LLMs can perform analysis on different programming languages directly from the same pseudo-code, obviating the need for developing different static analysis tools for different languages.

    - **Challenge 2: Reducing inaccuracies caused by LLM "hallucinations"**
      The paper proposes a general and lightweight method to verify the execution of pseudo-code, reducing the inaccuracies of the execution without the need for an external oracle. By verifying the pseudo-code execution, E&V indirectly mitigates the hallucinations and improves the accuracy of static analysis results.

#### Implementation and Deployment
In an evaluation using a prototype tool paired with GPT-4-32k, E&V was applied to categorize 170 recently fixed Linux kernel bugs. The prototype accurately identified the blamed function in 81.2% of the cases, significantly improving the accuracy of the results. The research also found that by verifying the execution of pseudo-code, the accuracy improved from 28.2% to 81.2%, significantly enhancing the precision and reliability of LLMs in static analysis.

#### Summary
This paper demonstrates the potential of LLMs in conducting pseudo-code static analysis and self-verification through the E&V method. The approach not only improves the flexibility and precision of static analysis but also reduces the human effort and specialized knowledge required to develop static analysis tools.
