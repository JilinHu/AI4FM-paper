#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the potential of large language models, specifically ChatGPT, in math question generation. Manually creating math questions is labor-intensive and not easily scalable. While automatic tools rely on fine-tuning strategies, they struggle with multi-step logical and mathematical reasoning problems. ChatGPT has shown excellence in logical and arithmetic reasoning in NLP tasks but is underutilized in generating educational math questions.

- **Existing Work**
Current work has not fully explored the potential of ChatGPT in generating educational math questions despite its proven capabilities in NLP tasks. The authors highlight that math question generation is a labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expert-based task, and current methods struggle with creating multi-step reasoning problems.

#### Core Contributions
  - **A study exploring the potential of using ChatGPT to automatically generate pre-university math questions**
      - **Challenge 1: Ability to generate context-aware questions**
      The challenge is evaluating ChatGPT's ability to generate math questions within a given context (context-aware). Existing methods struggle with generating problems that require multi-step reasoning. The research addresses this challenge by evaluating ChatGPT on existing math problem-solving benchmarks, categorizing different educational stages from elementary to high school, thus providing insights into the potential of ChatGPT in this field.

      - **Challenge 2: Practicability of generating context-unaware questions**
      The challenge is assessing the viability of ChatGPT to generate math questions without any given prior context (context-unaware). Since educators might not have any context or stories in advance to base questions on, this challenge is more realistically significant. To tackle this challenge, the study compiles TopicMath, a novel comprehensive collection of pre-university math curricula covering 121 math topics and 428 lessons, which is used to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in generating questions without a provided context.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper reports that ChatGPT's performance in generating questions varies across different math topics. To comprehensively evaluate ChatGPT in the context-unaware setting, the researchers employed national-level high school math Olympians from universities to gather 428 math lessons from Khan Academy, including mathematical definitions and example problems. They then instructed ChatGPT to generate question-answer pairs for each lesson according to the required difficulty levels. Through this analysis, the authors present 11 findings concerning ChatGPT's capability in generating pre-university math questions, hoping to provide valuable insights for educators and researchers on how to utilize modern AI technologies like ChatGPT for educational purposes.

#### Summary
The study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the potential of leveraging ChatGPT in the generation of pre-university math questions. It explores question generation in two main scenarios: with and without given context and aims to provide practical insights for educators. The findings from this study may promote the usage of modern AI technologies in education, enhancing the practicability and efficiency of automated math question generation.
