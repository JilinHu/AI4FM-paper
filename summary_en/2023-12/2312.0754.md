#### Background
- **Background**
This paper focuses on the challenges and solutions for language model agents in the context of long-term decision-making. The authors note that existing models struggle to learn effective strategies in complex games like NetHack, as the length of observations and interaction history exceed the model's capacity to handle.

- **Existing Work**
The existing work cannot effectively handle sequential decision-making tasks over long time spans because the model's input is limited by a fixed context length, compounded by the rapid accumulation of interaction history in complex decision environments.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a method for addressing long interaction history**
  - **Challenge 1: Processing long interaction history**
    To tackle long temporal dependencies, the paper introduces a new method called diff history, which computes differences between consecutive observations using Unix diff operations to effectively compress the length of interaction history.

  - **Challenge 2: Representation for action understanding**
    To differentiate between action and observation data, the paper introduces special tokens ((action-start)) and ((action-stop)), which help the model distinguish actions from observations in the interaction history and also simplify the process of text action decoding during inference.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments were conducted with the LangHack dataset, which contains 500,000 game segments generated using the AutoAscend bot for training and evaluation. The models were evaluated in various experimental setups, and it was found that the language models using diff history significantly improved in action prediction. For instance, after training for 16 epochs, the language model using diff history achieved an average NetHack score of 1885 points, while the model with raw interaction history scored only about 20 points. Additionally, the diff history approach allowed models to use an average of 4 times the history range during training.

#### Summary
The paper presents and validates the use of diff history to enhance model processing capabilities of long interaction histories. This method significantly improves model performance in complex decision tasks and effectively extends the length of history models can handle, providing new insights for the design of long-time series decision-making agents.
