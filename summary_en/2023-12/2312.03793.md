#### Background
- **Background**
The paper identifies that while large-scale text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have made significant advances in visual quality, motion, and temporal consistency in recent years, the generation process remains a black box. It lacks precise control over attributes other than rough text descriptions, such as appearance and motion.

- **Existing Work**
Existing works are unable to resolve the control issue since most video diffusion models (VDMs) are trained jointly on appearance and temporal aspects, making it difficult to control these two parts separately. Furthermore, there may be domain bias, such as a T2I model producing comic images while the I2V model is trained only with real-world clips.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced AnimateZero**
    - **Challenge 1: Control of Appearance and Motion**
        Existing T2V models struggle to separate control of appearance and motion. AnimateZero introduces spatial appearance control and temporal consistency control, allowing users to precisely control the appearance and motion of videos, achieving step-by-step video generation from T2I to I2V.

    - **Challenge 2: Domain-consistency**
        To ensure domain consistency of the videos generated, AnimateZero modifies spatial modules to insert the generated image into the first frame of generated videos, while also modifying motion modules to align subsequent frames with the first frame. This approach not only overcomes the issue of domain bias but also proves that pre-trained VDMs have the potential to be zero-shot image animators.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experimental results have shown that AnimateZero performs well across different personalized data domains. In video generation, AnimateZero surpasses AnimateDiff in terms of similarity to the text and the T2I domain. It excels in several metrics compared to current I2V methods and matches the best method in other metrics.

#### Summary
AnimateZero provides decoupled and precise control of appearance and motion for T2V generation, realizing step-by-step video generation from T2I to I2V, while maintaining good domain consistency through spatial appearance control and temporal consistency control.
