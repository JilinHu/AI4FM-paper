#### Background
- **Background**
Program reduction techniques are crucial for facilitating compiler debugging by automatically minimizing bug-triggering programs. These techniques generally fall into the category of either being language-generic or language-specific, such as those found in tools like Perses, Vulcan, and C-Reduce. However, properly balancing the generality across multiple programming languages with the specificity for individual languages remains a field ripe for exploration.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work hasn't effectively addressed a key challenge in program reduction, which is the trade-off between generality across languages and specificity to individual languages. Although language-specific reducers such as C-Reduce take advantage of language features to efficiently reduce programs, designing these reducers is labor-intensive and cannot cover all languages. Hence, existing reducers are either effective for specific languages or general but less optimal due to a lack of semantic language features.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduction of LLMs-Aided Program Reduction (Lampr)**
    - **Challenge 1: The Limitation of Language-generic Reducers**
      Existing language-generic reducers, such as Perses, though highly applicable across different programming languages, lack the capability for semantic understanding needed for further progress. The paper overcomes this limitation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing the ability to perform language-specific semantic level program transformations along with language-generic syntax level reduction.

    - **Challenge 2: Effectively Leveraging LLMs**
      LLMs face challenges, including comprehending subtle code differences and getting distracted by irrelevant context, which impede program reduction. Lampr introduces a multi-level prompting approach that guides LLMs to perform program transformations effectively, overcoming these challenges.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The Lampr technique employs LLMs to complement existing generic program reduction methods, allowing for language-specific reductions. The study compares its performance with Vulcan, a state-of-the-art language-generic program reducer, showing that Lampr outperforms Vulcan by producing smaller programs by 24.93%, 4.47%, and 11.71% on C, Rust, and JavaScript benchmarks respectively. Additionally, it is more time-efficient, reducing the completion time for all benchmarks in C, Rust, and JavaScript by 10.77%, 34.88%, and 36.96% compared to Vulcan.

#### Summary
Lampr represents a pioneering algorithm that integrates LLMs into the program reduction process. It achieves a balance between cross-language generality and particular language semantic awareness through a multi-level prompting method and assistance from LLMs, with superior performance demonstrated in empirical evaluations.
