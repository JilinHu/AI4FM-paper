#### Background
- **Background**
The paper examines the significant role of a visual projector in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This projector bridges the gap between pre-trained vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling profound visual understanding and leveraging the robust capabilities of LLMs. However, there has been relatively little exploration in this area. The paper first identifies two essential projector properties: flexibility in managing the number of visual tokens, crucial for the overall efficiency of MLLMs, and the preservation of local context from visual features, vital for spatial understanding.

- **Existing Work**
Most existing MLLMs simply use linear projectors or abstractors, with recent research favoring abstractors for their flexibility in handling the number of visual tokens. This flexibility offers various design options to find a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, abstractors struggle with tasks geared towards spatial understanding due to the absence of locality-aware design. Linear projectors, in contrast, excel at preserving the local context of visual features through one-to-one transformation.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a novel locality-enhanced projector**
      - **Challenge 1: Preserving the locality of visual features**
        To achieve both strong preservation of locality and increased efficiency, the paper introduces two locality-enhanced abstractors, C-Abstractor and D-Abstractor, employing two powerful operations in locality modelingâ€”convolution and deformable attention. These locality-aware designs not only enhance overall MLLM performance in handling complex visual information but also take advantage of computational efficiency in the subsequent response generation phase of LLMs.

      - **Challenge 2: Effective utilization of multifaceted instruction data**
        The paper proposes strategies for effectively utilizing multiple and multifaceted instruction datasets, providing solutions for important but less known design choices to maximize benefits from instruction data. It conducts extensive experiments to verify the impact of individual design choices on various benchmarks, offering valuable insights into training strong MLLMs.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The Honeybee model significantly outperformed previous best methods on various benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, and LLaVA-Bench, illustrating notably higher efficiency. Through in-depth analysis of design choices and implementation details for C-Abstractor and D-Abstractor, as well as strategies for visual instruction tuning, the paper validated the proposed method's impact on efficiency and performance.

#### Summary
The paper introduced a new type of locality-enhanced projector design, addressing deficiencies in existing methods in handling visual feature locality, and effectively utilized multifaceted instruction datasets. Consequently, the Honeybee model achieved significant performance improvements across multiple MLLM benchmarks.
