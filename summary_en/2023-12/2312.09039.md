#### Background
- **Background**
This paper highlights the progress made in table reasoning tasked for Large Language Models (LLMs). Such tasks call for reasoning over both free-form natural language questions and semi-structured tabular data. Nonetheless, existing solutions for table reasoning are significantly challenged by "huge" tables and complex questions due to the lack of essential information or dispersion of relevant details across various locations.
- **Existing Work**
The current approaches fail to properly tackle the performance drop caused by large tables and are unable to effectively handle complex questions since these solutions lack necessary information on the tables or the information is scattered across multiple places, challenging direct utilization of LLMs like GPT.

#### Core Contributions
  - **TAP4LLM: A table provider concept**
    - **Challenge 1: Selecting key content from long and complex tables**
      TAP4LLM addresses this by "Table Sampling," decomposing original tables into sub-tables with specific rows/columns based on rules or semantic similarity.
    - **Challenge 2: Enhancing LLM's understanding of tables**
      The "Table Augmentation" module of TAP4LLM enhances table information by extracting semantic and statistical metadata from raw tables and retrieving relevant knowledge from trusted sources like Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia.
    - **Challenge 3: Balancing token allocation and knowledge packing**
      Through the "Table Packing" module, TAP4LLM packs sampled tables and augmented knowledge into sequence prompts for LLM reasoning while managing the trade-off of token allocation.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The article conducted various experiments to assess TAP4LLM, demonstrating it enhances LLM's understanding of tabular data across diverse table tasks. The description of experimental setups, comparative results, and trade-offs provides proof of TAP4LLM's effectiveness.

#### Summary
The TAP4LLM framework proposed in this paper significantly enhances the performance of Large Language Models in tabular reasoning tasks. It operates by sampling, augmenting, and packing semi-structured data and can also serve as a plugin to further enhance LLMs' understanding of structured data.
