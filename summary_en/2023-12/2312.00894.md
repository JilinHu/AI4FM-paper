#### Background
- **Background**
The widespread use and increasing complexity of REST APIs necessitate improved automated testing tools, which often overlook valuable unstructured natural language descriptions in API specifications, leading to suboptimal test coverage.

- **Existing Work**
Existing technologies like NLP2REST and ARTE attempt to address this gap by extracting rules from human-readable descriptions and querying knowledge bases for meaningful input values, but they are limited in the types of rules they can extract and often produce inaccurate results.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced RESTGPT**
    - **Challenge 1: Accuracy and quality of rule extraction and input value generation**
      RESTGPT harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the GPT-3.5 Turbo, to improve REST API testing. By parsing OpenAPI specifications, extracting machine-interpretable rules, and generating example parameter values from natural-language descriptions within the specifications, RESTGPT ensures that the outputs are both relevant and precise.

    - **Challenge 2: Ensuring extensibility while seamlessly integrating with existing API specifications**
      During the specification enhancement phase, RESTGPT extracts machine-readable components from API specifications and integrates the extracted rules into these components during the building phase, enriching and enhancing the API specification for more robust and informed testing.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Preliminary results indicate RESTGPT's significant improvement over existing approaches. Compared to NLP2REST without a validation module, RESTGPT improved precision from 50% to 97%. Against NLP2REST with its validation module, precision still rose from 79% to 97%. Additionally, RESTGPT was able to generate syntactically and semantically valid inputs for 73% of parameters across analyzed services and operations, a notable increase from the 17% by ARTE. These results validate the efficacy of RESTGPT and its potential in leveraging LLMs for REST API testing improvements.

#### Summary
RESTGPT addresses the limitations of existing methods in extracting rules from natural language descriptions and generating effective values by leveraging the accuracy and efficiency of LLMs, especially GPT-3.5 Turbo, significantly enhancing the quality and accuracy of REST API testing.
