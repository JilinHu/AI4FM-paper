#### Background
- **Background**
This paper studies visual language models (VLMs) which have recently seen rapid progress thanks to large language models (LLMs). It notes that while there have been many efforts on visual instruction tuning to extend LLM with visual inputs, there is a lack of in-depth study of the pre-training process, which is costly but crucial for modality alignment.

- **Existing Work**
Most effort in the field has been aimed at improving the visual language instruction tuning process, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but not enough attention has been paid to the pre-training process that trains the model on image-text datasets at scale.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Proposed a pre-training method for Visual Language Model: VILA**
    - **Challenge 1: Freezing LLMs during pre-training achieves zero-shot performance but lacks in-context learning (ICL) capability**
      The paper argues the need for updating LLMs during pre-training to encourage deep embedding alignment, which is important for ICL capabilities.

    - **Challenge 2: The impact of dataset choices and training protocols on pre-training performance**
      The paper highlights the significance of interleaved pre-training data for providing accurate gradient updates and maintaining text-only capability. Adding text-only instruction data during SFT also helps mitigate text-only task degradation and enhance visual language task accuracy.

#### Implementation and Deployment
VILA demonstrates superior performance across various vision language tasks compared to state-of-the-art models such as LLaVA-1.5, thanks to the enhanced pre-training process. VILA also revealed several capabilities such as multi-image reasoning, stronger in-context learning, and enhanced world knowledge, showcasing the benefits of thorough pre-training with interleaved visual language data.

#### Summary
VILA employs an improved pre-training strategy, outperforming benchmarks in various vision-language tasks, and offers practical guidance for the design of future visual language models.
