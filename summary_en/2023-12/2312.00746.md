#### Background
- **Background**
The article discusses the need for rigorous evaluation of Large Language Model (LLM) based agents in interactive environments. Prior work, including ROLELLM and Tachikuma, has not addressed the complexities and new challenges presented by JuBensha games, which involve strategy, deduction, and social interaction. 

- **Existing Work**
Previous work proposed frameworks for evaluating LLM agents in role-playing scenarios but none specifically tailored to the complexities of JuBensha games. JuBensha games feature variable outcomes based on player choices and demand new evaluation approaches for LLM agents due to their strategic, deductive, and interactive nature.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Challenge 1: Evaluating LLM agents' capabilities in interactive environments**
      Existing frameworks have difficulties in fully assessing the abilities of LLM agents for complex skills in games like JuBensha, which involve combinatorial reasoning, persuasion, and negotiation. The new proposed evaluation methods are more robust and specifically tailored to the complexities and new challenges introduced by JuBensha games.

  - **Challenge 2: Compiling a challenging Jubensha Dataset**
      A comprehensive dataset from over 1100 Chinese JuBensha game instances was compiled. This dataset poses multifaceted challenges for AI research, including complex text understanding, advanced reasoning and strategy, and simulating social behavior and emotional intelligence, pushing beyond current AI capabilities and laying the groundwork for future advancement.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper introduces an interaction framework for LLM-based agents tailored for script murder (Jubensha) games named ThinkThrice, aimed to enhance agentsâ€™ complex reasoning abilities in multi-agent mystery games through a three-stage data flow process.: 1) Initial answer generation with memory retrieval; 2) Answer enhancement with self-refinement; 3) Answer verification with self-confirmation. In Jubensha games, LLM agents are endowed with specific character information and interact with others based on this, including other players and the host.

#### Summary
The paper provides a new evaluation method adapted to the complexity and new challenges of JuBensha games and establishes a new framework, ThinkThrice, for assessing the capabilities of LLM agents in an interactive gaming environment, advancing AI applications in multiplayer role-playing games.
