#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper discusses the evolutionary process of Generative AI, particularly focusing on the transformative impacts of Mixture of Experts (MoE) multimodal learning and the speculated advancements towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It examined how innovations like Google's Gemini and the anticipated OpenAI Q* project are reshaping research priorities and applications across various domains, including an impact analysis on the Generative AI research taxonomy.

- **Existing Work**
Current researches do not showcase the transformative impacts of MoE models in multimodal learning and fail to fully assess the computational challenges, scalability, and real-world implications of these technologies. Moreover, they do not sufficiently address the academic challenges brought about by the influx of both AI-themed and AI-generated preprints and their impact on the peer-review process and scholarly communication.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a thorough survey**
  - **Challenge 1: Integrating Innovation and Utility**
      The study delves into how the practical and potential advances brought by MoE multimodal learning can significantly propel progress in sectors like healthcare, finance, and education. By analyzing Google's Gemini and ~Q* project, the paper demonstrates their transformative effects on research priorities and applications in multiple domains.

  - **Challenge 2: Evaluating the Academic Impact of AI-Generated Preprints**
      The paper discusses how AI-generated preprints affect the peer-review process and scholarly communication and the necessity to establish ethical and human-centric AI development methods that comply with societal norms and welfare, setting a strategy for future AI research that focuses on a balanced and conscientious use of MoE multimodality and AGI in generative AI.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Evaluation results show that emerging multimodal AI systems like Gemini have surpassed traditional text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and have set new benchmarks. The paper explores the technical challenges of multimodal systems including creating robust and diverse datasets, managing scalability, and enhancing user trust and interpretability of the system. It suggests that these challenges must be addressed through methods such as explainable AI to achieve seamless and intelligent interaction aligned with human expectations. Additionally, the paper provides a current Generative AI research taxonomy which serves as a foundational framework to understand the current state of the field.

#### Summary
This review extensively analyzes the development of the generative AI field and its reshaping effects on the research landscape, with a special focus on MoE multimodality learning and AGI prospects. The study spans a comprehensive taxonomy from AI model structures and training techniques to application domains and ethical considerations.
