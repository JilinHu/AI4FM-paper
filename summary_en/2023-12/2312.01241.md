#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses the rising security threats in open-source software and the need for efficient identification and management of security patches. Open-source software has become integral to modern computing infrastructure but brings challenges due to inconsistencies in maintenance by software providers, leaving security patches often released without detailed advisories and exposing users to unresolved security risks.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work mainly focuses on using machine learning algorithms with syntax features or sequence-based deep neural networks to process patches, such as the GraphSPD method. However, most of these approaches focus on local code segments and may miss the broader context of how functions or modules interact. Even though GraphSPD has succeeded in capturing the context within patches, it still lacks the capability of utilizing Large Language Models to capture essential context and tokens within the source code.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced an LLM-based security patch detection model (LLMDA)**
    - **Challenge 1: Improving the accuracy of security patch detection**
      Existing technologies focus more on the local structure of the code rather than its broader context which may lead to high false-positive rates. LLMDA incrementally examines patches and guides the model in differentiating security-related patches with labeled instructions, integrating patches with code using a PTFormer to create hybrid attributes that include details of both patches and code. This unique combination method allows the system to capture more insights from the joint context of patches and code, thus improving detection accuracy.

    - **Challenge 2: Managing and Combining Multimodal Inputs to Enhance Detection**
      LLMDA addresses the issue of handling and integrating multimodal inputs by combining generated explanations and instructions with patches, source code, and descriptions. By encoding and aligning different modal inputs into a single space, LLMDA can learn on multiple fronts and uses a Stochastic Contrastive Learning module to obtain the final binary output regarding security or non-security.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The evaluation concentrated on the capability of the framework to detect security patches and the effectiveness of key design decisions. Based on a literature review, the authors selected baseline methods and evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrated that the framework consistently outperformed baseline methods (e.g., TwinRNN and GraphSPD) on both target datasets (PatchDB and SPI-DB). Specifically, LLMDA achieved a 42.86% and 20.05% improvement over state-of-the-art on the respective target datasets. The paper also emphasized the practical applicability of the framework by validating its performance in terms of detection precision in secure software maintenance.

#### Summary
The paper presents an innovative security patch detection framework, LLMDA, utilizing Large Language Models for patch analysis and data augmentation, and aligning multimodal inputs. This enables the system to extract more extensive information from the combined context of patches and code, thereby enhancing detection accuracy.
