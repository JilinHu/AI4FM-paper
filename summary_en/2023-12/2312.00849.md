#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the impressive capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, it also highlights the significant issue faced by current MLLMs: the tendency to generate hallucinations or ungrounded text that does not validly represent the associated images, rendering them untrustworthy and impractical for real-world applications.

- **Existing Work**
The problem is attributed to the lack of positive/negative human feedback in instruction-tuned models, which are unable to learn precise behavior boundaries to eliminate hallucination. Traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods have been challenged by annotation ambiguity and learning efficiency issues, making it hard to learn desired behaviors without a substantial amount of labeled data and leading to potential reward hacking.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduction of the RLHF-V framework**
      - **Challenge 1: Hallucination Issues**
          RLHF-V aligns MLLM behavior with human preferences by learning from human feedback. It collects feedback in the form of fine-grained corrections directly on hallucinated text segments from model responses. The approach counters linguistic and bias variance, ensuring accurate allocation of feedback and enhancing learning efficiency while preventing reward hacking.

      - **Challenge 2: Learning Efficiency**
          The methodological innovation includes the introduction of Dense Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO), a variant of DPO that tackles the RLHF objective in an equivalent, simplified, and more efficient supervised fashion. DDPO optimizes the policy model against segment-level preferences, where hallucinated segments are corrected to be factually grounded, addressing learning efficiency directly.
   
#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments conducted on five benchmarks demonstrate that RLHF-V significantly enhances the trustworthiness of MLLMs. Using only 1.4k annotations, RLHF-V managed to reduce the hallucination rate of base MLLMs by 34.8%, outperforming similar models trained with larger datasets. In comparison with GPT-4V, RLHF-V shows superior robustness in preventing hallucinations due to over-generalization.
   
#### Summary
RLHF-V presents a novel strategy to rectify MLLM behavior via fine-grained, correctional human feedback. It collects quality data to align MLLM learning with human preferences, effectively improving the models' reliability and practicality in various tasks. This study represents a significant advancement in enhancing the robustness of large multimodal language models.
