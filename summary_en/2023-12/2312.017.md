#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses the fundamental role that data management plays in the training of Large Language Models (LLMs). It emphasizes the importance of constructing well-suited training datasets to enhance model performance and improve training efficiency during both pretraining and supervised fine-tuning phases.

- **Existing Work**
The existing work lacks a systemic analysis of the rationale behind data management strategy selection, its consequential effects, methodologies for evaluating curated datasets, and the pursuit of improved strategies. Moreover, many prominent LLMs do not disclose or only document the procedures chosen for the construction of their pretraining data, leaving the reason behind it unclear. In the supervised fine-tuning stage, the performance and instruction-following abilities of LLMs are primarily evoked by carefully designed instruction datasets, but practitioners still find it confusing about the effect of instruction datasets on the performance, thereby leading to difficulties in choosing proper data management strategies in LLM fine-tuning practices.

#### Core Contributions
- **Provided a Comprehensive Overview**
    - **Challenge 1: Importance of Data Management in LLM Training**
        The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current research in data management, covering various key aspects such as data quantity, data quality, and domain/task composition. It also identifies the existing challenges and promising future directions for the development of this field.

    - **Challenge 2: Lack of Systematic Analysis**
        By providing a missing systematic analysis on the rationale behind management strategy selection, its consequential effects, and methodologies for evaluation and improvement of strategies, the paper serves as a guiding resource for practitioners looking to build powerful LLMs through effective data management practices.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper does not provide specific experimental results and evaluation data, so it is not possible to give a comparative analysis with related work.

#### Summary
This survey studies the current state of research in data management at both the pretraining and supervised fine-tuning stages of LLMs and the design of data management strategies.
