#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the critical importance of synthesizing semantically aware, long-horizon human-object interaction in order to simulate realistic human behaviors. The researchers put forth a method for generating synchronized object motion and human motion guided by language descriptions in 3D scenes.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work mainly focuses on human-scene interaction with static objects, such as sitting on a chair, overlooking the highly dynamic interactions that frequently occur in daily life. Although some progress has been made in modeling dynamic human-object interactions, these approaches only pay attention to smaller objects or lack the capability to manipulate a variety of objects. In addition, current research typically relies on sequences of past interaction states or complete sequences of object motion and cannot synthesize object motion and human motion from just initial states alone.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced the CHOIS (Controllable Human-Object Interaction Synthesis) method**
      - **Challenge 1: Achieving language-guided synchronization of object and human motion synthesis**
      Current methods can't assure that object motion aligns with input waypoints and do not ensure the realism of interactions that require precise hand-object contact and proper contact grounded by the floor. The paper's method tackles this by incorporating an object geometry loss as additional supervision during training and designing guidance terms that reinforce contact constraints during the sampling process.

      - **Challenge 2: Synthesizing long-horizon interactions in complex environments**
      The key is the combined use of language and object waypoints, which do not need to be dense or precise, allowing for the utilization of existing path planning algorithms to generate waypoints representing long-horizon interactions in complex scenarios. Based on this finding, a method is developed that synthesizes human-object interactions guided by language and sparse object waypoints using a conditional diffusion model, and it demonstrates the ability to synthesize realistic interactions on the FullBody-Manipulation dataset.
  
#### Implementation and Deployment
The CHOIS method is integrated into a system that can synthesize continuous, realistic, and context-aware human-object interactions based on 3D scene and language input. The interactions generated by the system align with directives specified in the language input and conform to the environmental constraints set by waypoint conditions derived from 3D scene geometry. Additionally, the study shows that the interaction synthesis model learned can generalize to novel objects in the 3D-FUTURE dataset. By comparing and analyzing research results, the paper proves the effectiveness and broad applicability of its method in real-world scenarios.

#### Summary
The paper proposes a novel interaction synthesis method, CHOIS, which is capable of generating synchronized human and object motions under the guidance of language descriptions, adhering to the geometric constraints of 3D scenes. Integrated into a system, it demonstrates its efficacy in synthesizing continuous, realistic, and context-aware human-object interactions.
