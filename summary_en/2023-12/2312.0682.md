#### Background
- **Background**
The article introduces the design purpose of the Microsoft Windows Feedback Hub, which is to receive customer feedback on various topics including critical issues such as power and battery. Feedback is a very effective way to grasp users' experience with Windows and its ecosystem. However, the vast amount of feedback received by the Feedback Hub makes diagnosing the actual cause of reported issues immensely challenging.

- **Existing Work**
A main challenge currently faced is that in the DML (Double Machine Learning) pipeline, model design (e.g., causal graph) often requires domain knowledge, which sometimes is either unavailable or hard to obtain. While reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) are leveraged to generate a prior model to compensate for the lack of domain knowledge and to be used as a heuristic for measuring feedback informativeness, LLMs are prone to hallucinations and incorrect answers when performing reasoning tasks, thus they do not completely solve the problem.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Challenge 1: Dealing with a Large Volume of Feedback Data**
The solution to the challenge brought by the volume of data is to use LLMs to generate a prior model that can compensate for the lack of domain knowledge to some extent, and to use heuristic assessment of feedback informativeness to better understand and triage issues.

  - **Challenge 2: Suppressing LLMs' Hallucination and Incorrect Reasoning**
By designing multiple prompts and using self-consistency to suppress fallacies and incorrect reasoning, the frequency of LLMs producing hallucinations is reduced, thus making it possible to extract causal variables from user feedback.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper validated the efficacy of its proposed method through a series of experiments. First, feedback received was classified using zero-shot learning, then ICL was used to design multiple prompts to extract causal variables and sequences of events. Hallucinations and incorrect reasoning are mitigated using self-consistency and an ensemble of prompts. The extracted causal variables are then used to create causal graphs, which serve as prior models in the causal inference process. The paper also introduced two heuristic scoring methods to assess the richness of feedback information, aiding engineers in reducing the volume of low-quality feedback and prioritizing richly informative feedback. Experimental results showed that the proposed method could extract known issues, uncover new bugs, and identify sequences of events leading to a bug while minimizing off-domain outputs. Approximately 81% of extracted outcomes/treatments are among bugs/reasons pre-classified by engineers, but there are also 19% that are new bugs/treatments discovered by the model, and about 56% of event sequences are new chains previously unknown to engineers and warrant further investigation.

#### Summary
The research presents a novel framework utilizing LLMs and ICL to extract self-consistent causal insights from user feedback to support analysis in Microsoft's Feedback Hub. The framework employs innovative self-consistency and prompt ensemble techniques to mitigate hallucinations and incorrect reasonings in LLMs and introduces two heuristic methods to assess the richness of feedback information. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the method in extracting causal insights and new bugs, and in assisting Microsoft engineers to prioritize feedback rich in information.
