#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper notes that Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate evolving in-context learning abilities through prompt engineering. However, the critical challenge of enhancing the generalizability and factuality of LLMs in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Question Answering (QA) tasks remains under-explored.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research mainly focuses on how to make models adhere to user-specific instructions and quality expectations and avoid undesired outputs. However, little to no work has looked at using task-specific fine-tuned Language Models (SLMs) to improve LLMs' in-context learning during the inference phase.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a framework named SuperContext**
    - **Challenge 1: Improving the generalizability of LLMs when dealing with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data**
        The SuperContext framework integrates supervised knowledge from SLMs outputs to enhance LLMs' reliability, specifically in terms of improving the model's generalization on OOD data. It achieves this by incorporating the fine-tuned model's predictive results and confidence levels as supplemental information into LLMs' prompts, enhancing performance in OOD settings for various tasks.
        
    - **Challenge 2: Minimizing hallucinations in generative tasks**
        The framework also focuses on strengthening LLMs' accuracy with the support of SLMs to reduce hallucinations in generative tasks. In QA tasks involving unanswerable questions, SuperContext demonstrates the ability to minimize hallucinations through an enhanced discriminative-model approach.

#### Implementation and Deployment
SuperContext has been experimentally validated in both zero-shot and few-shot settings of NLU and QA tasks. Empirical results on comprehensive benchmark GLUE-X and QA dataset SQuAD 2.0 show that the method significantly outperforms both LLMs and SLMs in OOD settings across 9 distinct tasks. This highlights SuperContext as a pioneering approach to systematically integrate SLMs into LLM inference decisions, significantly enhancing LLM performance, especially in managing OOD data and mitigating hallucinations.

#### Summary
The SuperContext framework proposed in the paper significantly enhances the generalizability and factuality of LLMs in natural language understanding and question answering tasks by leveraging the supervised knowledge from task-specific fine-tuned SLMs. It represents an innovative approach to incorporating the strengths of small models into LLMs to deal with OOD data and minimize hallucinations.
