#### Background
- **Background**
This paper discusses how modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit proficiency in a range of tasks, indicating that they systematically integrate information about the world, termed as "knowledge". However, accessing the knowledge in LLMs is challenging because factual statements produced by LLMs do not always represent the knowledge encoded within them.
- **Existing Work**
Current research introduces an unsupervised learning algorithm named contrast-consistent search (CCS) to elicit latent knowledge within LLMs. It is premised on the assumption that knowledge fulfills a consistency structure, which can be detected using the CCS loss function. However, the authors argue that the CCS consistency structure is not just slightly imprecise but is actually compatible with arbitrary patterns, suggesting that existing methods are insufficient for exploring hidden knowledge in LLMs.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Theoretical Proofs**
      - **Challenge 1: Validity of the CCS Consistency Structure**
      The paper first theoretically proves that any arbitrary binary classifiers are optimal under the CCS loss; then it demonstrates that a transformation preserving the CCS loss to any classifier exists. This shows that the CCS consistency structure is not unique to knowledge but is compatible with arbitrary patterns, challenging the accuracy of knowledge elicitation.
      - **Challenge 2: Unsupervised Method Feature Detection**
      A series of experiments revealed that unsupervised methods like CCS, in practice, do not discover knowledge but instead learn other more prominent features. This suggests that current unsupervised methodologies are not adequately discovering latent knowledge in LLMs.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Through a series of experiments, the authors confirmed that unsupervised methods like CCS and PCA have clear issues in practical applications. They tend to learn noise data (such as additionally added opinions) rather than knowledge, are sensitive to minor changes in prompts with no principled reason to choose any particular prompts. Experiments show that, despite different principles, CCS generates very similar predictions to PCA, highlighting that CCS does not exploit the consistency structure of knowledge. This issue may persist in future methods.

#### Summary
The paper challenges the capacity of existing unsupervised methods to explore latent knowledge in LLMs through theoretical proofs and experimental validations while providing sanity checks to consider for future knowledge elicitation method evaluations. Overall, the authors suspect that future unsupervised methods are likely to face similar issues, having difficulty in accurately distinguishing between model knowledge and other features.
