#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses that language models with transformer architectures, although capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant texts across various use cases with impressive performances, sometimes produce erroneous or overconfident outputs, raising concerns about the models' calibration. This issue becomes particularly pressing as users leverage a new paradigm known as in-context learning (ICL) to construct powerful predictors, especially for applications in safety-critical domains.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work has shown that entropy in each generation step can be recalibrated using scaling techniques like temperature scaling, but the paper demonstrates that the miscalibration issue in ICL cannot be easily addressed by these traditional recalibration methods that rely on additional validation data.

    - **Challenge 1: Calibration Issues of ICL**
        The study finds that language models such as GPT-2 and LLaMA are poorly calibrated. As the number of in-context samples increases, both prediction accuracy and calibration error increase. Notably, this calibration degradation worsens with larger model sizes or when fine-tuning with specialized data such as curated instructions, dialogues, or human preference data. Assessing calibration at token-level through a Bayesian perspective allows quantification of the discrepancy between perceived and actual performance.

    - **Challenge 2: Reasoning and Prediction Analysis in Reasoning Tasks**
        The paper delves into how calibration affects the performance in reasoning tasks, particularly those involving generating explanations for answers. Results show that calibration decreases after generating a lengthy context for reasoning and explaining final answers.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper used traditional NLU tasks and reasoning question-answering tasks to conduct in-context learning experiments in a k-shot setting, recording performance and calibration errors in mis-calibrated and recalibrated scenarios. It showcased accuracy and expected calibration error for complex reasoning, including the varying impact of adjusting model size and finetuning on model accuracy and calibration error. Different prompt generation strategies were employed in various experiments to explore their effect on model performance and calibration. It was found that including labels in the prompt could reduce uncertainty and enhance reasoning effectiveness, while merely repeating the context without labels did not improve performance. The study also revealed that the diversity in prompt construction significantly affects performance, especially for larger language models. The study showed that finetuning models like vicuna and alpaca became more accurate but less calibrated, with significant disparity in reasoning tasks.

#### Summary
The paper conducts an in-depth study of the calibration accuracy in language models (LMs) for in-context learning (ICL) and presents methods for evaluation and analysis. It reveals the relationship of calibration errors with model size and the changes during finetuning, as well as the reduction in calibration during the generation of reasoning tasks.
