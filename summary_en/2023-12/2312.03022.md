#### Background
- **Background**
The paper introduces that the primary task of Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) is the extraction of entities, relations, and events to build the knowledge graph, where traditionally, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been viewed as solitary task-solving agents. However, the paper proposes that the creation of knowledge graphs is not limited to individual intelligence, as team cooperation and their interactions can enhance model performance.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research has proposed different methods to combine the capabilities of LLMs to handle KGC tasks, which include transforming question answering into a multi-turn question and answer architecture, integrating KG structural information into LLMs, and so on. However, current methods tend to focus on advancing the abilities of individual agents and rarely consider the potential of collaboration among different agents within tasks, overlooking the importance of team collaboration.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced cooperKGC**
  - **Challenge 1: Enhancing the efficiency of team collaboration**
      A collaborative team achieves better results on target tasks, but more cooperation rounds don't necessarily yield better outcomes. cooperKGC balances the interaction frequency within a multi-agent team to ensure that the expert agents' beliefs are not disturbed by excessive external information. 

  - **Challenge 2: Subtleties of team intelligence**
      The paper investigates how the mechanics of collaboration within multi-agent teams affect the display of team intelligence, including their diversity of expertise when engaged in collaborative work. The analysis delves into social theories to deeply understand the behaviors and decision-making tendencies of expert agents during multi-turn conversational interactions.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experimental results demonstrate that the cooperKGC method can provide higher precision results compared to cognitive processes operating in isolation once the cooperation mechanism is introduced. This framework utilizes a collaborative operational network of multiple agents, enabling effective information exchange between agents through multi-round interactions, which enhances the abilities of knowledge selection, correction, and aggregation, thus optimizing the entire KGC process.

#### Summary
By introducing a multi-agent cooperation approach within KGC, the cooperKGC framework improves the precision with which agents solve tasks involving entity, relation, and event extraction, and potentially lays the foundation for a future of collaboration-aware AI.
