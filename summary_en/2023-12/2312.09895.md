#### Background
- **Background**
The paper tackles the challenge of performance enhancement in tasks like automatic speech recognition or spoken language understanding by accessing contextual information from preceding text or audio. The existing methods, though effective, require the previous utterances and can be resource-intensive due to the large text-based language models needed during fine-tuning and inference.

- **Existing Work**
The paper highlights the limitations of previous work, noting that they do not fully leverage generative large language models to generate context information and are reliant on actual preceding dialogues, which can add computational burden at inference time.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced Generative Context-aware Fine-tuning**
    - **Challenge 1: Dependence on actual preceding segments**
      The paper proposes the novel approach of using generative large language models to generate text and extract context embedding from it. This method reduces reliance on the real preceding segments or text models at inference time, enabling performance gains without the corresponding resource overhead.

    - **Challenge 2: Utility and relevance of generated text**
      The paper explores various prompt designs for generating relevant contextual information from preceding text and evaluates the effectiveness of different-sized LLMs in this task. Furthermore, it develops a generative context-aware fine-tuning module to distill the context into a compact network, allowing the system to predict contextual information without requiring other language models at inference time.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The proposed method was evaluated using the SLUE and Libri-light benchmarks across several downstream tasks, including automatic speech recognition, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. The results indicate that generative context-aware fine-tuning outperforms the context injection approach that uses ground-truth preceding text. It also competes well with a generative context injection approach that requires an LLM at inference time, demonstrating the proposed method's effectiveness in utilizing generated context while reducing runtime dependencies.

#### Summary
The paper presents a new fine-tuning method for self-supervised speech models that leverages text generated by large language models as context to enhance task performance. It provides a way to reduce dependence on extra large models and resource usage during inference without compromising on performance.
