#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the significance of De novo drug design, a pivotal issue in pharmacology and a new area of interest in AI research. The main challenge in this field is to generate molecules with specific properties and to provide a wide variety of candidate molecules.

- **Existing Work**
Though advanced technologies like transformer models and reinforcement learning have been applied in drug design, the paper suggests that their potential has not been fully utilized.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced an algorithm named MolRL-MGPT**
  - **Challenge 1: Increasing Molecular Diversity**
      The paper introduces an approach where multiple GPT agents work collaboratively to search for favorable molecular structures in various directions to increase molecular diversity. This approach demonstrated promising results in the GuacaMol benchmark and proved effective in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 protein targets.

  - **Challenge 2: Accurate Drug Design**
      The paper applies the MolRL-MGPT algorithm to the public de novo molecular design benchmark GuacaMol, as well as demonstrating the real-world application of the algorithm in designing inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 protein targets.

#### Implementation and Deployment
MolRL-MGPT combines a transformer model (specifically, a miniaturized GPT model) with reinforcement learning, using a model characterized by SMILES strings for pre-training chemical language. The paper elaborates on the algorithmâ€™s detailed implementation, including multiple GPT agents and the loss function designs that encourage molecular diversity and reduce repetitive searching among agents. In the GuacaMol benchmark tests, MolRL-MGPT outperformed all other advanced methods in terms of total score. In experiments targeting SARS-CoV-2 protein targets, the algorithm generated several inhibitor candidates, showcasing its potential and effectiveness in practical applications.

#### Summary
The paper introduces a reinforcement learning algorithm with multiple GPT agents for drug molecular generation and demonstrates good performance and practicality in GuacaMol benchmark tests and in designing inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 protein targets.
