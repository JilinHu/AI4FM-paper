#### Background
- **Background**
The current LLMs, such as ChatGPT, have excellent performance in various coding tasks, prominently in code generation. However, the effectiveness of these models within specific domains such as web development remains insufficient and necessitates further scrutiny.
  
- **Existing Work**
Current LLMs for code generation rely greatly on extensive training data to acquire a broad range of knowledge for open domains, and assessments typically focus on open-domain benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. These benchmarks consist of programming contests that don't fully encompass the complexities and challenges of real-world code generation scenarios.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a new code generation approach called DomCoder**
    - **Challenge 1: Domain-specific code generation**
      The existing LLMs show sub-optimal performance in generating domain-specific code due to limited proficiency in utilizing domain-specific libraries. The researchers built a domain-specific code dataset and analyzed the abilities of various LLMs to overcome this challenge.
    
    - **Challenge 2: Efficiently utilizing domain knowledge to prompt LLMs for domain-specific code generation**
      The researchers explored several strategies to integrate domain knowledge, such as querying external knowledge GPT (kg-GPT), chain-of-thought prompting (CoT-PT), and chain-of-thought fine-tuning (CoT-FT), proving that these strategies improve the effectiveness of domain-specific code generation under certain conditions.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Researchers first investigated the capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT, CodeGen, and PolyCoder in specific domains. Despite significant advancements in open-domain applications, their performance dropped significantly in specific domains, with ChatGPT's CodeBLEU score falling by 51.48% on average. This performance degradation was often caused by a lack of domain knowledge, particularly the improper use of third-party libraries. The study then examined how to effectively prompt LLMs with domain knowledge. Various basic knowledge-based prompts were designed and utilized to guide the LLMs in generating more professional code. Experiments showed consistent improvements across all datasets when using knowledge-enhanced prompts.

#### Summary
The study demonstrates that LLMs' capabilities in domain-specific code generation can be significantly enhanced by effectively integrating domain knowledge into the code generation process. The DomCoder approach exemplifies the incorporation of different strategies to blend domain knowledge and boost the actual effectiveness of code generation within certain contexts.
