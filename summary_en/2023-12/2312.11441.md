#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper touches on the use of large language models (LLMs) in applications such as personal assistants and business agents, emphasizing the importance of transferring information and fostering collaboration. However, the secure transfer of sensitive information and privacy protection are challenges not yet addressed by existing research.

- **Existing Work**
Due to concerns about privacy leakage, current works are unable to facilitate knowledge transfer between LLMs while protecting user privacy.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introducing the framework of social learning**
    - **Challenge 1: How to transfer knowledge without revealing private information**
      The social learning framework allows agents to generate examples and instructions for task-specific information transfer while emphasizing the privacy of shared examples and knowledge. This provides a method for knowledge transference between models in a human-interpretable way without sharing private data.
    - **Challenge 2: How to evaluate social learning methods**
      The paper benchmarks and evaluates social learning implementations across a diverse set of tasks and establishes metrics to measure private data leakage, proving the positive benefits of social learning while preserving privacy.
    
#### Implementation and Deployment
For the implementation of the learning protocol, the paper designed a use case, namely spam detection in Short Message Service (SMS). In this setup, multiple "teacher" agents convey a task to a "student" agent through text interactions without sharing original examples to protect privacy. The student acts as an aggregator during training, selecting a subset of examples from teachers, and relies on this transferred knowledge to answer task instances at inference time. The paper evaluates these methods across different datasets and privacy quantification methods, showing that the results are comparable to those using the original labels and prompts, with low memorization of the original data.

#### Summary
The paper presents a novel framework for knowledge transfer in LLMsâ€”social learning, and provides solutions for privacy protection. The framework allows for knowledge exchange between models using natural language while preventing the leakage of sensitive information, and it validates its effectiveness and privacy-preserving capabilities through experimentation.
