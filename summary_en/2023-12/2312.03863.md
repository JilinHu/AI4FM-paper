#### Background
- **Background**
The paper provides a review on the advancements in language models concerning sparse activation methods, particularly Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and the significance of long-context processing, highlighting the challenges current language models face in handling extensive texts.

- **Existing Work**
Present studies show that processing long contexts incurs substantial computational expenditure, limiting model efficiency. Existing language models demonstrate limitations when extending input text lengths, constrained by the capabilities and designs of positional encoding techniques inherent in their architecture.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**  
    - **Challenge 1: Effective training of MoE-based Large Language Models (LLMs)**
      There are current challenges in controlling the number of experts and ensuring equitable task distribution in training MoE models. The paper reviews several MoE optimization approaches at the algorithm level, such as Expert Choice, StableMoE, X-MoE, which propose strategies to enhance training efficiency, ensure balanced task distribution, and adjust model structures dynamically.

    - **Challenge 2: System-level acceleration of MoE-based model training**
      To address the challenges of efficiently training MoE models in a distributed computing environment, the paper discusses a series of acceleration frameworks including FastMoE, FasterMoE, DeepSpeed-MoE, Tutel, and SmartMoE. These frameworks feature support for flexible model design, adaptation to various applications, and runtime strategy optimization.

#### Implementation and Deployment
This survey does not provide original implementation details or specific deployment situations. However, it does summarize a variety of MoE optimization strategies and system acceleration frameworks, briefly mentioning their design focuses and potential performance improvements. For example, FastMoE offers a hierarchical interface for adapting to different applications; FasterMoE uses a performance model to predict latency and alleviate network congestion by adjusting expert selection; DeepSpeed-MoE has designed a dense-MoE hybrid (PR-MoE) that reduces model size without sacrificing quality.

#### Summary
