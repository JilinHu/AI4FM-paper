#### Background
- **Background**
The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) prompted discussions in the scientific community regarding their potential to enhance the quality of scholarly research and figuring out how to best utilize such models to accelerate scientific practices. Significant and non-trivial questions have arisen: Do LLMs genuinely improve our scientific output, or are they a hindrance to good scientific practice? Considering the ethical and legal concerns associated with them, to what extent should they be used?

- **Existing Work**
The predominant view focuses on utilizing LLMs as knowledgeable research assistants that provide knowledge or technical support. There's an emphasis on cautiously approaching LLMs, highlighting the inherent limitations and potential bias of these models. It's emphasized that despite the assistance LLMs provide in areas such as programming, writing support, and knowledge extraction that contributes to improved scientific practice, we must still be aware of the potential errors and inaccuracies they might cause.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a discussion on the long-term impact of LLMs in social science**
    - **Challenge 1: Protecting the status quo and looking to the future**
        The paper argues that it's our main responsibility to ensure the quality and integrity of our work while adhering to established scientific practice rules. LLMs, while providing accurate and immediate feedback beneficial to refining scientific processes such as literature review, should be used within limits, especially considering the privacy and reproducibility issues associated with the models.

    - **Challenge 2: Machine writing and the validation of science**
        Science is a social process that can't be auto-completed. The optimism of LLMs functioning as reviewers and even playing a part in scientific activities is considered misplaced. The paper stresses that we should not overestimate the time required to vet LLM outputs, and questions their suitability in scientific activities, suggesting that LLMs are often misused and hyped within science.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper concludes with a lean towards LLMs as auxiliary tools rather than direct participants in scientific research. The authors argue that avoiding anthropomorphizing LLMs is essential; they are not research assistants but tools that generate errors, which necessitates careful understanding and use. The paper also discusses the advantages of models designed explicitly for specific tasks over LLMs in terms of efficiency, performance, interpretability, and repairability. In essence, science consists of conversations among scientists, and synthetic text-generating machines that only produce seemingly coherent prose are not a substitute for human interaction in scientific inquiry.

#### Summary
The paper discusses the implications of LLMs on scientific practices and recommends a cautious approach to their usage, emphasizing the importance of protecting the normative and epistemic aspects of science. Although LLMs may improve the efficiency of certain research tasks, they should be used judiciously as tools that abide by scientific norms and standards.
