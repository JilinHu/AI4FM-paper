#### Background
- **Background**
The paper investigates fake news detection with an augmented fact-checking approach using ChatGPT. The authors collected news statements from the PolitiFact news fact-checking website and used the ChatGPT API to generate truthfulness scores and supporting evidence for evaluating the quality of ChatGPT's text output.

- **Existing Work**
Previous studies have relied on human reporters' accounts for fact-checking. This paper explores combining a large language model with human fact-checking to assess the capability of the large language model in detecting fake news.

#### Core Contributions
- **Developed the ChatGPT-FC dataset**
    - **Challenge 1: News Accuracy after Corpus Updates** 
        The study shows that ChatGPT had a higher accuracy ratio within its training corpus time range, but there is a significant difference in news statements after the corpus was updated, indicating a reduced ability to discriminate. The paper demonstrates this through a time-sensitive analysis.

    - **Challenge 2: Consistency and Bias Analysis**
        The paper examines the opinion consistency between ChatGPT and human journalists and analyzes potential biases, particularly regarding content and labels related to political statements, finding that ChatGPT's evaluations tend to be more fact-based, whereas the labels provided by human journalists are often more ambiguous.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper states that of the 22,337 news statements checked by ChatGPT, 14,961 were true statements and 7,359 were fake. Reports generated by ChatGPT have significantly fewer words and sentences on average than those by human journalists. Although there were cases where ChatGPT failed to provide a truthfulness score, it could effectively pre-filter potential fake news articles for human journalists. The study also reveals biases that may exist.

#### Summary
The paper presented the first publicly available benchmark dataset for fake news detection, ChatGPT-FC, which combines human verification and ChatGPT assistance. Quantitative analysis was conducted to compare human journalists and LLMs in fact-checking, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance the objectivity and reliability of news fact-checking processes.
