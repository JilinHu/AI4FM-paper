#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the research community and industry due to their powerful language understanding and reasoning capabilities, particularly in the context of multimodal tasks like vision-language learning, audio and speech recognition, and video understanding. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) heavily rely on modality-specific encoders which are usually different in architecture and limited to common modalities.

- **Existing Work**
The construction of MLLMs in the past research has typically required specific encoders and projection modules for each modality, whose architectures often differ and require substantial effort to unify into a single framework. Moreover, the pretrained encoders that deliver reliable performance are typically restricted to widely-used modalities like image, audio, and video, limiting the ability of MLLMs to expand to more modalities.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a unified framework**
      - **Challenge 1: Creating a unified and scalable encoder**
        The limitation of existing LLMs is their inability to adapt to modalities beyond the most commonly used ones, posing the challenge of developing a unified and scalable encoder capable of handling a wide range of modalities. The approach taken by the paper is informed by other research indicating that modality-specific pretrained encoders may not be necessary; instead, a well-pretrained transformer could function as a universal cross-modal encoder.

      - **Challenge 2: Enhancing multimodal understanding and instruction adherence**
        The paper builds OneLLM, an MLLM that integrates eight distinct modalities, utilizing a universal encoder and projection module, and introduces an innovative Universal Projection Module (UPM) and dynamic routing strategy, to progressively align additional modalities to the LLM. The large-scale multimodal instruction dataset they curated, covering eight modalities including image, audio, video, etc., provides the model with powerful multimodal understanding, reasoning, and instruction-following capabilities.

#### Implementation and Deployment
OneLLM was evaluated on 25 diverse benchmarks including tasks such as multimodal captioning, question answering, and reasoning. It demonstrated superior performance compared to previous specialist models and MLLMs. The code, data, model, and online demo are all made available on GitHub.

#### Summary
OneLLM showcases strong multimodal understanding and processing capabilities through its unified multimodal encoding framework and progressive alignment pipeline, addressing the challenge of expanding multimodal LLMs in the area of reasoning and utilization.
