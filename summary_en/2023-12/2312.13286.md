#### Background
- **Background**
The paper highlights the struggle of existing multimodal systems to mimic the human capability of solving multimodal tasks with ease through a few examples or simple instructions.

- **Existing Work**
Current multimodal models are not capable of solving tasks in context like humans and typically rely on task-specific architecture and large supervised training sets.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a generative multimodal model named Emu2**
    - **Challenge 1: How to enhance the in-context learning capabilities of a multimodal model and effectively generalize it to unseen tasks**
      By scaling up the model with 37 billion parameters and demonstrating the effective pre-training on multimodal sequences with a unified autoregressive objective (predicting the next multimodal element), Emu2 significantly improves in-context learning capabilities, including abilities such as on-the-fly reasoning, visual prompting, and object-grounded generation.

    - **Challenge 2: Fine-tune the model for specific instructions to execute challenging tasks**
      After instruction tuning, Emu2 is capable of handling interleaved text-image-video inputs and outputs, making it a powerful and versatile base model for various multimodal tasks. It showcased state-of-the-art few-shot performance on several visual question-answering datasets.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Emu2 achieved advanced results in the few-shot settings across a range of vision-language tasks, and state-of-the-art results on visual question-answering tasks, surpassing models with more complex designs. Additionally, Emu2 can be fine-tuned as a controllable visual generation model of high quality, capable of accepting combinations of text, locations, and images as conditions and generating precise images. The model's performance improves as the number of examples in context increases.

#### Summary
The paper successfully enhances the context learning capabilities of the multimodal generative model Emu2 by scaling up the model and achieves breakthrough results on a spectrum of multimodal understanding tasks, especially in visual question-answering and controllable visual generation after instruction tuning.
