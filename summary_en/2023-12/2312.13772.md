#### Background
- **Background**
Machine learning and NLP have been transformed by the advancements in large language models (LLMs). Among different learning paradigms, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) stand out for their effectiveness in few-shot learning scenarios. However, they are prone to overconfidence, especially in limited-data setups.

- **Existing Work**
Previous studies focused on the performance of LLMs on out-of-distribution (OOD) data or introduced in-context examples into training. Most research targeted general-purpose LLMs, leaving the study of task-specific performance and calibration and the balance between them for specialized models relatively unexplored. Real-world applications of models demand accurate and well-calibrated predictions.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Provided in-depth analysis**
    - **Challenge 1: Balancing Performance and Calibration**
      The paper investigates the behaviors of different learning methods from the perspectives of performance and calibration, discovering that achieving joint gains in task performance and calibration in resource-constrained scenarios is demanding.

    - **Challenge 2: Model Calibration in Low-Resource Settings**
      The study explores using self-ensembling techniques to tackle model calibration issues in limited-data scenarios, showing that self-ensembling can significantly reduce calibration errors.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The method proposed involves applying self-ensembling at different modeling stages and comes with the potential of increasing both task performance and calibration without compromising either. Controlled experiments on seven classification datasets demonstrate the positive impact of self-ensembling, reducing calibration errors by an average of 43% and also improving task performance. Moreover, the approach saves resources and time by modifying a single model for different tasks.

#### Summary
This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the performance and calibration of different learning methods in data-scarce scenarios. It indicates challenges in jointly achieving high performance and good calibration, but demonstrates that self-ensembling techniques can enhance model calibration without sacrificing performance, providing important guidelines for future LLMs applications.
