#### Background
- **Background**       
    This paper notes that as Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in tasks such as question answering, translation, text summarization, and dialogue systems, the need for accuracy in information becomes crucial, especially for financial products like Alipay serving billions of users. To address this, Alipay has developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that grounds LLMs on the most accurate and up-to-date information. However, in real-world products serving millions of users, the inference speed of LLMs becomes a critical factor compared to a mere experimental model.

- **Existing Work**
    Existing technologies such as quantization, sparsity, pruning, distillation, and tensor decomposition have been proposed to reduce the size of LLMs and the I/O consumption time for predicting each token, but these technologies result in a degradation of accuracy. The authors also analyze methods like non-autoregressive machine translation (NAT) and iterative parallel decoding, which however, show limited effectiveness in question-answering scenarios. A recent trend in decoding strategy uses a draft model, which requires extra training effort or finding an available draft model. Additionally, a strategy called LLMA has been developed, as shown in [16], involving the matching of text spans from retrieved documents without requiring significant extra effort. Although these methods have merits, it is observed that they perform poorly beyond document-retrieval scenarios. 

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced the Lookahead Inference Acceleration Framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Improve inference speed while maintaining lossless generation accuracy**
        To tackle the challenge of inference latency in generative tasks and retain the accuracy of generation results, the authors propose an innovative multi-branch strategy. The Lookahead framework meticulously records input and output token lists with a Trie tree, allowing for the prediction of multiple paths based on provided context tokens through a parallel Verification and Accept (VA) process.

    - **Challenge 2: Utilize the parallel computing power of GPUs**
        Lookahead takes advantage of GPU's parallel computing capabilities through an adaptive strategy to optimize the path-retrieval process, effectively balancing memory and computation requirements. The experimental method shows that Lookahead outperforms existing acceleration methods in accelerating inference speed for LLMs, and even in the worst case, it performs equivalent to the conventional process.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The Lookahead framework has been widely applied to real-world scenarios of Alipay, including financial RAG, health suggestions, medical report summaries, and more. The framework is implemented based on the transformers library of Hugging face by extending a generation mode named lookahead generation, which supports greedy search and sample strategy with batch inference. Additionally, the framework has been applied to the latest LLMs such as GLM, Llama, OPT, GPT2, BLOOM, ChatGLM, Baichuan, and Qwen, etc. They also plan to soon release their work as open source. Through a series of empirical experiments, the authors demonstrate that the Lookahead framework significantly improves inference speed with lossless accuracy and reduces costs.

#### Summary
The paper presents the Lookahead inference acceleration framework, which uses a Trie-tree based multi-branch inferencing strategy to improve the inference speed of LLMs while maintaining the accuracy of generation. The framework's performance is validated through extensive experimentation and has been deployed in real-world scenarios at Alipay.
