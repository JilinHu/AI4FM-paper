#### Background
- **Background**
The article addressed the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in reasoning capabilities. It pointed out that despite the increase in model parameter size and implicit knowledge, reasoning abilities are not equivalent to language skills. Inductive reasoning is a particular shortcoming of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, which often fail in some very simple reasoning problems, despite sometimes demonstrating impressive reasoning abilities.
- **Existing Work**
Evaluating a model's reasoning skills usually involves assessing various skills in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning across different NLP tasks that require such skills. However, since reasoning is a broader concept, it's challenging to conclusively state whether a model can "reason" based on existing and current works on reasoning, which are also scattered.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a more nuanced method to evaluate ChatGPT's reasoning abilities**
    - **Challenge 1: Confounding Reasoning**
        Existing evaluation methods fail to accurately determine whether a model possesses reasoning capabilities. The paper investigates ChatGPT's reasoning ability in a more fine-grained manner, including deductive, inductive, abductive, analogical, causal, multi-hop, mathematical, temporal, and spatial reasoning through question-answering tasks, manually verifying the accuracy of responses and the generated rationales by ChatGPT. Tests were categorized to avoid overlap.

    - **Challenge 2: Lack of Non-textual Semantic Reasoning**
        Evaluations of ChatGPT's reasoning abilities revealed deficiencies in non-text semantic understanding, such as mathematical, temporal, and spatial reasoning, especially with poor performance on the MATH dataset that tests mathematical reasoning. This evaluation exposed ChatGPT's shortcomings in spatial reasoning tasks, such as errors in understanding clock directions and diagonal spatial relations.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Due to space limitations, complete implementation and deployment information cannot be provided here. However, the paper mentions that various categorized question-answering tasks were used to evaluate ChatGPT's different types of reasoning abilities. For instance, in logical reasoning, bAbI tasks and other advanced tasks were used to test deductive and inductive reasoning. Non-textual semantic reasoning was tested with datasets like MATH, Timedial, SpartQA, etc. Results are displayed in Table 5 of the paper, showing that ChatGPT performed significantly better in tasks of deductive, causal, multi-hop, and analogical reasoning but struggled with inductive, mathematical, and spatial reasoning tasks.

#### Summary
The article evaluated ChatGPT's reasoning abilities in a more granular way and identified a key issue in LLMs - the lack in non-text semantic understanding. This finding offers significant directions for future improvements and research into the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
