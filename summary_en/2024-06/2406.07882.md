#### Background
- **Background**
This paper tackles the opacity issue of Large Language Models (LLMs) in conversational dialogue, where users often struggle to understand how and why the system produces specific responses. Such opacity becomes particularly concerning when considering issues of bias and authenticity.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work fails to effectively address the transparency issue since simply asking the system to explain its reasoning often leads to persuasive but spurious explanations, or to the system avoiding the question entirely.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a dashboard prototype**
    - **Challenge 1: Designing a User Experience**
      The researchers faced the challenge of designing an interface that allows users to understand and control the internal model representation of the AI system. This challenge was addressed by developing a dashboard interface that displays the AI system's internal model of the user in real-time.
    - **Challenge 2: Enhancing Transparency to Combat Bias**
      Another challenge was to increase the system's transparency to enable users to recognize and combat potential biases. This was approached by giving users the ability to modify the system's internal model of themselves, thereby changing the system's behavior.
      
#### Implementation and Deployment
The results show that users appreciated the design, with the dashboard providing insights into the chatbot's responses, raising user awareness of biased behavior, and offering controls to explore and mitigate those biases. The researchers also report on user reactions and suggestions related to bias and privacy issues, which could help inform future design and machine learning research.
Compared to existing work, this study provides a method that is more suited to the needs of ordinary users to increase transparency and understanding by visualizing internal states and allowing users to control these states.

#### Summary
The paper is aimed at increasing the transparency of LLMs within conversational AI systems and does so by designing a visualized user interfaceâ€”a dashboard that accompanies the chatbot interface. User can see the system's internal user model in real time and modify it via the interface. Based on user feedback, the dashboard also helps unveil and counteract model biases.
