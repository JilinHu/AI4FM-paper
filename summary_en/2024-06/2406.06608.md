#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the widespread and increasingly deployed Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems in various industries and academic settings, where developers and end users interact through prompts or prompt engineering. Despite the popularity and vast research on the concept of prompting, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes a prompt due to the nascent nature of the field.

- **Existing Work**
Current work lacks a systematic and structured understanding of the concept of a prompt due to the novelty of the field, necessitating a structured survey and analysis of prompting techniques.

#### Core Contributions
  - **A systematic survey of prompting techniques**
      - **Challenge 1: Lack of unified terminology and structured understanding**
        Addressing this challenge, the paper establishes a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyses their usage, presenting a comprehensive vocabulary of 33 terms and categorizing 58 text-only prompting techniques, along with 40 techniques for other modalities.
      - **Challenge 2: The need to analyze the overall literature to understand natural language prefix-prompting**
        The paper presents a meta-analysis of the literature, especially focusing on natural language prefix-prompting.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper provides a detailed explanation of the review process, text-based techniques, the usage of prompting techniques, as well as prompt engineering and answer engineering. It also delves into areas beyond English text prompting, covering multilingual and multimodal prompts, and extending the realm of prompting techniques. The research presented in the paper is enlightening for the development of more effective prompting systems and contributes further to the optimization and understanding of the entire generative AI systems spectrum.

#### Summary
This paper offers a comprehensive survey of prompting techniques, systematically analyzing the concept, types, and applications of prompts and making an extensive meta-analysis of the literature.
