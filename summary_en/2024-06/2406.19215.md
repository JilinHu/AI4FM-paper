#### Background
- **Background**
This paper addresses the issue of hallucination in large language models (LLMs), where LLMs generate seemingly correct but factually incorrect answers, typically as a consequence of queries exceeding the limited parametric knowledge boundaries of LLMs.

- **Existing Work**
The current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, which retrieve and integrate knowledge for every input query by default, are criticized for being inefficient and unnecessary due to the noisy nature of data storage. This can lead to misleading or even conflicting information when LLMs are capable of extracting the correct answer from their parametric knowledge alone. Hence, adaptive retrieval strategies have been proposed to determine dynamically whether external knowledge is required and to invoke retrieval accordingly.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced SEAKR Model**
      - **Challenge 1: When to Retrieve**
      Existing adaptive RAG methods judge the sufficiency of knowledge in LLMs based solely on their outputs, which can be biased. SEAKR utilizes the internal self-awareness of LLMs to make dynamic decisions on when to retrieve and to integrate retrieved knowledge effectively.

      - **Challenge 2: How to Integrate**
      SEAKR re-ranks retrieved knowledge snippets by the LLM’s self-aware uncertainty to preserve the snippet that most reduces their uncertainty. It utilizes this self-aware uncertainty to choose among different reasoning strategies, aiding in solving complex tasks that require multiple retrievals.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experiments performed on various Question Answering datasets demonstrate that SEAKR surpasses existing adaptive RAG methods. The code is made available on the authors' GitHub repository. Despite a lack of detailed evaluation and comparison data presented in the summary, the mentioned performance improvements of the SEAKR model over existing adaptive RAG methods suggest potential for practical applications.

#### Summary
The paper proposes the SEAKR model, a novel adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation model that uses the self-awareness of LLMs’ internal states to dynamically determine when to retrieve and effectively integrate knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in QA tasks.
