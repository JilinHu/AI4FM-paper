#### Background
- **Background**
  The paper discusses the significant capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various natural language processing tasks, with a focus on the downstream task of machine translation (MT). However, current approaches fail to deliver the satisfactory translation quality that matches supervised neural machine translation (NMT) systems. It is presumed that the straightforward prompts used are insufficient to fully leverage the instruction-following abilities of LLMs.

- **Existing Work**
  Existing research seeks to enhance LLMs' translation performance through prompt engineering and instruction tuning but often overlooks machine translation's inherent requirements for diverse multilingual knowledge. These efforts typically involve a simplified reasoning process and do not fully exploit the complex nature and linguistic knowledge involved in language modeling by LLMs.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced the TASTE framework**
      - **Challenge 1: Enhancing LLMs' performance in translation tasks**
        TASTE encourages the improvement of translation quality by LLMs through a two-stage inferencing process. First, LLMs are directed to generate preliminary translations with concurrent self-evaluations. In the second stage, they are instructed to refine these preliminary translations based on the evaluation outcomes.

      - **Challenge 2: Equipping LLMs with the multitasking ability to execute the entire self-reflective translation process**
        Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multi-task training datasets ensures that LLMs can execute the complete reflective translation process. This method has stimulated LLMs' potential and enhanced the model's translation performance.
  
#### Implementation and Deployment
Evaluation results in four language directions on the WMT22 benchmark demonstrate the TASTE framework's superiority over existing methods. Using TASTE, LLMs can proficiently enhance their initial translation outputs based on self-assessments, resulting in translations of superior quality and an overall boost in their translation capabilities.

#### Summary
The TASTE framework proposed in this paper elevates LLMs' capability in machine translation through a self-reflection process, representing a novel way to harness the translation potential of LLMs. It sets a new benchmark for understanding and utilizing the complex reasoning and language modeling capabilities of LLMs.
