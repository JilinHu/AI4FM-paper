#### Background
- **Background**
This paper underlines the heavy dependence of large language models' (LLMs) performance on the quality and size of their pretraining datasets. However, state-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama 3 and Mixtral have pretraining datasets that are not publicly available and have scarce information regarding their creation process. The aim of this paper is to narrow the gap between proprietary datasets and public knowledge by developing and releasing the FineWeb datasets, which are large-scale pretraining datasets for training performant LLMs.

- **Existing Work**
The paper states that while Common Crawl provides ample data for LLM training, the performance of the models heavily relies on how web text is filtered and preprocessed before being used for training. For example, web text may contain a lot of "unnatural" language, like boilerplate text and gibberish. Training on such data can damage the performance of LLMs because most downstream applications of LLMs do not involve this type of data. On the other hand, filtering too much can result in a dataset that is too small to train a general use model sufficiently.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu datasets**
  - **Challenge 1: How to filter and preprocess web text**
    The study tackles this by introducing a large-scale pretraining dataset FineWeb, which comprises 15 trillion tokens of text sourced from 96 Common Crawl snapshots. FineWeb creates a principled strategy for selecting and tuning filtering heuristics, diving deep into how different deduplication strategies and granularities can impact performance. The models trained on FineWeb outperformed those trained on other publicly available web-based pre-training datasets, proving the effectiveness of the curation.

  - **Challenge 2: How to obtain models with better performance on knowledge and reasoning-intensive benchmarks**
    To address this challenge, researchers created the FineWeb-Edu dataset, a subset of 1.3 trillion tokens from FineWeb, which was rated as highly educational by a custom classifier. Models trained on FineWeb-Edu significantly outperformed others on knowledge and reasoning-intensive benchmarks like MMLU and ARC.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The FineWeb data curation process was thoroughly documented and dissected in the study. Along with the datasets, the data curation codebase and all the models used in the ablation experiments were also made public. The researchers hope that by releasing these materials, they can contribute to improving public knowledge and resources in curating pre-training datasets for LLMs. In validation of their design choices, the paper demonstrated that models trained on FineWeb performed better than those trained on other publicly available web-based pre-training datasets, showing the successful performance improvements through data curation.

#### Summary
This paper introduced the FineWeb datasets, highlighting the importance of carefully curating an effective Common Crawl-based pretraining dataset and demonstrated its contribution to enhancing the performance of large language models.
