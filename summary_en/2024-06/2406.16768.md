#### Background
- **Background**
This paper addresses the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), aiming to encourage outputs with high rewards using a reward model trained on human preferences. The issue at hand is that RLHF typically incorporates a KL regularization to prevent forgetting pre-trained knowledge, which hampers reward optimization.

- **Existing Work**
Existing approaches constrain reward optimization by integrating a KL regularization with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) initialization serving as the anchorâ€”however, using the SFT model as the anchor might lead to underfitting rewards, due to the inherent tension between reducing KL and maximizing rewards.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a novel strategy named WARP (Weight Averaged Rewarded Policies)**
      - **Challenge 1: Improving the trade-off between KL and reward**
        The paper proposes the use of Weight Averaging (WA) to improve the trade-off, leveraging linear mode connectivity which finds high-performance linear paths between fine-tuned models. WARP merges policies through weight averaging at different stages.
      - **Challenge 2: Iteratively optimizing performance and alignment**
        WARP employs three variations of WA: initially using the policy's exponential moving average as a dynamic and updatable KL anchor; then spherical linear interpolation to merge independently fine-tuned policies; and finally, interpolation towards initialization. This iterative process uses each iteration's final model as an advanced initialization for the subsequent round, progressively refining the KL-reward Pareto front and achieving higher rewards at a fixed KL.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments show that WARP improves the quality and alignment of Gemma policies, surpassing other open-source LLMs. WARP is a straightforward strategy designed to optimize the KL-reward Pareto front of solutions. It employs three variants of WA over different stages of the alignment procedure, each based on its distinct benefit. The experimental results demonstrate that WARP provides superior rewards at a fixed KL compared to other strategies.

#### Summary
The article proposes WARP, a new strategy for LLM alignment, which merges models through weight averaging to address challenges in the RLHF process, thus improving the trade-off between KL and rewards. Experimental evidence suggests that WARP enhances model performance and alignment with human values.
