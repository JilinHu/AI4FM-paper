#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex mathematical reasoning tasks, particularly when the number of reasoning steps required increases. LLMs' current capabilities in handling these tasks resemble the "System 1" mode of thinking in psychology, which is fast and intuitive but prone to errors.

- **Existing Work**
Despite efforts to enhance LLMs' "System 1" abilities, such as hierarchical prompting and automatic prompt refinement, these methods still have limitations in dealing with complex mathematical reasoning tasks that necessitate deliberate thinking and iterative refinements. Attempts have been made to use tree search algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS, and MCTS) to mimic the "System 2" mode of thinking. However, these approaches often require expert-designed utility functions and immense computational resources, limiting their deployment in practical applications.

#### Core Contributions
  - **A novel tree search algorithm with dynamic node selection and node-level exploration budget calculation**
    - **Challenge 1: Resource Consumption**
      The researchers introduce a novel tree search algorithm that considers the progress of the search towards the final answer (history) as well as guidance from a value network (future) trained without any step-wise annotations. The algorithm iteratively selects the most promising tree node for expansion within the confines of the allocated computational budget.

    - **Challenge 2: Performance**
      The algorithm demonstrates competitive performance on the GSM8K and TabMWP datasets, with a significantly reduced computational cost compared to baseline methods.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The study validates the effectiveness of the new algorithm through experiments conducted on the GSM8K and TabMWP datasets. The results show that the method not only matches the performance of other strategies but also significantly lowers computational costs compared to traditional search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and other methods that use custom utility functions.

#### Summary
The paper contributes by introducing a more efficient tree search algorithm that reduces resource consumption in aiding LLMs to tackle complex mathematical reasoning tasks, while ensuring high performance levels.
