#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses that current language agents primarily rely on proprietary models or are designed for specific tasks such as mathematics or multi-hop questionnaire answering.
  
- **Existing Work**
Existing agents use API calls and proprietary models which are difficult to scale due to the associated costs and delays. Additionally, recent open-source LLMs focus on specific tasks or require complex data curation and inference procedures for the agent.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a language agent named HUSKY**
  - **Challenge 1: Multi-step reasoning tasks over a unified action space**
      HUSKY is a holistic open-source agent capable of addressing multi-step reasoning tasks over a unified action space. It employs a simplified and generalizable system to generate tool-integrated solution trajectories by few-shot prompting a teacher model. This enables HUSKY to not only encompass numerical, tabular, and knowledge-based reasoning tasks but also to surpass prior language agents on multiple evaluation datasets.
  - **Challenge 2: Enhancing efficiency in solving complex reasoning problems**
      By deconstructing tasks into a series of executable actions and utilizing tools to perform each action until a terminal state is reached, HUSky presents a distinctively generalizable yet efficient approach to train and deploy open-source language agents across a clipid range of tasks while maintaining a unified action space. With 7B models, HUSKY achieves or exceeds the performance of frontier LMs like GPT-4 on the HUSKYQA evaluation set.

#### Implementation and Deployment
HUSKY's implementation consists of two main components: an action generator and expert models. The action generator predicts the next step and the corresponding tool, while the expert models execute the action using the tool and update the current solution state. This articulation allows HUSKY to self-update while performing tasks until it concludes with the final answer. The system demonstrates better cross-task generalization compared to other language agents like FIREACT and LUMOS and outperforms them in their domain of tasks.

#### Summary
HUSKY emerges as the first unified, open-source language agent for multi-step reasoning that resolves the issues of high costs and difficulties in scaling while demonstrating superior performance in multi-task environments, showcasing the potential of open-source language agents.
