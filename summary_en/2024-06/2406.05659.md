#### Background
- **Background**
Large language models (LLMs) are competent in tasks like summarization, question answering, and translation. However, they encounter challenges in Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, particularly in open-ended questions. ToM reasoning is critical for recognizing others' intents, emotions, and thoughts, and LLMs' ability to truly understand and align with human ToM reasoning in open-ended scenarios requires further exploration.

- **Existing Work**
While LLMs excel at structured tasks, their limited ability in zero-shot ToM reasoning that demands nuanced comprehension and integration of human mental states has been demonstrated in multiple-choice and short answer questions but not in open-ended questions.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Addressing ToM Reasoning in Open-Ended Questions**
      - **Challenge 1: Insufficient ToM reasoning capabilities in open-ended questions**
        The paper presents a comparative analysis highlighting significant discrepancies in ToM reasoning abilities between human and LLM-generated responses, noting that even the most advanced models have substantial limitations.
      - **Challenge 2: Effectively integrating human intentions and emotions**
        To improve LLM functionality, a prompting method incorporating human intentions and emotions was implemented, leading to enhanced ToM reasoning performance. However, this enhancement still doesn't achieve fully human-like reasoning.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Using content from Redditâ€™s ChangeMyView forum, the study analyzes the ability of LLMs to respond to queries, with a focus on how integrating individual mental states can improve this capability. Comparative analysis shows important gaps in open-ended question reasoning capabilities between human and models like Zephyr-7B, Llama2-Chat-13B, and GPT-4, even after applying prompt tuning methods to integrate human intentions and emotions, indicating a continued need for development in this arena.

#### Summary
The study underscores the deficiencies in LLMs' social reasoning and the potential improvement by integrating human intentions and emotions. The findings highlight the need for LLMs to comprehend human-like mental states for effective social reasoning in open-ended questions, pointing out a key direction for future advancement.
