#### Background
- **Background**
The article discusses the increasing complexity of software systems and how ensuring high availability and reliability for large-scale distributed software systems has become a challenge. Though current ML and DL-based Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) methods provide significant assistance in software system failure management, they still face challenges such as a need for complex feature extraction engineering, lack of cross-platform generality, and lack of cross-task flexibility.

- **Existing Work**
The existing ML or DL-based AIOps methods are not effective in addressing failure detection, localization, diagnosis, and timely repair. This is mainly because these methods require extensive preprocessing and feature engineering; their ability to deal with unstructured data such as logs and traces is limited, and they are usually tuned and trained for a specific software system, causing significant performance deterioration when the software system changes or executes different tasks. In addition, these methods have limited model adaptability and often require frequent model training and updates to adapt to new data and environments when the software system changes.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a Survey**
  - **Challenge 1: Understanding and processing unstructured data**
      Existing AIOps methods have a relatively weak capability in understanding and processing unstructured data, whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively process and understand such data, often eliminating the need for prior feature extraction.

  - **Challenge 2: Need for cross-platform generality and cross-task flexibility**
      LLMs have been trained on a large amount of cross-platform data, thus possessing strong generality and logical reasoning capabilities. They output natural language, hence can perform multiple AIOps tasks simultaneously, such as determining the cause of a problem and the involved software components. Moreover, LLMs' pre-training enables them to effectively adapt to new data and environments, maintaining their performance even when faced with changes to the software system.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper does not have specific implementation and deployment details as it is a survey paper. The survey provides a technology background, definition, and LLM-based approaches for AIOps in the era of LLMs for failure management, covering the AIOps subtasks, specific LLM approaches, challenges, and future directions. It encompasses everything from metrics to logs, time-series analysis, failure perception, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and automated remediation.

#### Summary
This paper is a comprehensive survey of AIOps technology for failure management in the era of LLMs. It discusses the potential of LLMs to address the challenges faced by existing AIOps methods and outlines the future directions of research.
