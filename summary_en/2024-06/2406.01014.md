#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the popularity of mobile device operation tasks as a multi-modal AI application scenario. Current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), restricted by their training data, lack the capability to effectively function as operation assistants. Instead, MLLM-based agents, which enhance capabilities through tool invocation, are being applied to this scenario.

- **Existing Work**
The two major navigation challenges in mobile device operation tasks—task progress navigation and focus content navigation—are not effectively solved by the single-agent architecture of existing work due to overly long token sequences and the interleaved text-image data format, which limit performance.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a multi-agent architecture Mobile-Agent-v2**
      - **Challenge 1: Task Progress Navigation**
          The planning agent condenses lengthy, interleaved image-text history operations and screen summaries into pure-text task progress, which is then passed to the decision agent. This compaction reduces context length, making it easier for the decision agent to navigate task progress.

      - **Challenge 2: Focus Content Navigation and Reflection Ability**
          A memory unit and a reflection agent were designed to address the issue of navigating focus content and the reflection ability. The memory unit is updated by the decision agent with focus content, and the reflection agent assesses whether the decision agent's operation meets the expectations, providing appropriate remedial measures if not.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Mobile-Agent-v2 underwent dynamic evaluations across various operating systems, language environments, and applications. Results show more than a 30% improvement in task completion compared to the single-agent architecture. Additionally, manually injecting operation knowledge was empirically validated to further enhance performance.

#### Summary
Mobile-Agent-v2 is a multi-agent architecture designed to effectively tackle navigation challenges in mobile device operation tasks, particularly task progress and focus content navigation, significantly improving task completion rates over traditional single-agent architectures.
