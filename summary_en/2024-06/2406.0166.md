#### Background
- **Background**
The existing online and offline Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods like PPO and DPO have seen tremendous success in aligning AI with human preferences. However, they have a fundamental flaw as their optimal solutions are notably task-dependent and not robust to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) tasks.

- **Existing Work**
The issue with the existing methods is their high task dependency, meaning the challenge to adapt to OOD tasks is significant. A model that performs well on one task might underperform or fail on a new unseen task, limiting its generalizability.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced Self-Improving Robust Preference Optimization (SRPO) framework**
  - **Challenge 1: Task dependency and OOD robustness**
    While traditional methods like PPO and DPO excel on the tasks they were trained on, their performance cannot be guaranteed when tasks change. SRPO addresses this by turning the problem of learning from human preferences into a process of self-improvement, which can be mathematically expressed in terms of a min-max objective. This goal is task-independent, enhancing the robustness of the model to task variations.
  
  - **Challenge 2: Need for an optimization method without the necessity of reward models and online inference**
    SRPO provides a solution to this issue, which can be expressed through a non-adversarial offline loss form. This loss can be optimized using standard supervised optimization techniques without any need for a reward model and online inference, greatly simplifying the training and deployment process.
  
#### Implementation and Deployment
In the experiments, SRPO is compared against two offline preference learning methods, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimization (IPO). It trains both the standard generative policy and the self-improvement policy simultaneously through a single optimization process. SRPO first generates completions with the 0-revision (0-rev.) model then improves these completions using the self-improvement model. For evaluation, SRPO was tested on the Reddit TL;DR Summarization dataset and XSum dataset, showing that SRPO 4-rev. produces high-quality summaries with the highest win rate in in-distribution testing. In the OOD setting, SRPO 5-rev. attained the highest win rate, outperforming the baseline methods with the same number of revisions.

#### Summary
SRPO successfully alleviates the task dependency problem by demonstrating robustness to task variations within a theoretically grounded offline RLDF framework. It offered a simpler training and deployment process through the optimization of a non-adversarial offline loss. Experimental results indicate that SRPO outperforms existing methods across different environments, including OOD settings.
