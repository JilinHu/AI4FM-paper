#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the significance of security issues in software development, especially security vulnerabilities in code that can be exploited by attackers for malicious activities. Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series have been leveraged as tools for code review and repair to address these security issues automatically. While LLMs have shown great capabilities in natural language processing tasks, challenges remain when handling domain-specific tasks such as addressing code security issues.

- **Existing Work**
Previous research has demonstrated the proficiency of LLMs in understanding and generating code, but when applied to resolving security issues, these models often lack domain-specific expertise and precise guidance, rendering them unreliable for identifying and fixing security flaws. Moreover, existing methods commonly omit a detailed review process for model outputs, preventing the models from effectively learning from feedback and improving their ability to solve security issues.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a novel approach named FDSS**
    - **Challenge 1: How to effectively enable LLMs to understand and fix security vulnerabilities in code**
        The FDSS method incorporates feedback from the static code analysis tool Bandit with LLMs, enabling them to receive detailed guidance on code security issues and generate possible solutions. This is crucial for enhancing the LLMs' capabilities to solve security issues.

    - **Challenge 2: How to improve the performance of LLMs on code security issues**
        The analysis results of the researchers show that the FDSS approach significantly improves the performance of LLMs in addressing security issues compared to other methods that do not include feedback from Bandit. Specifically, the improvements seen on GPT-3.5 and CodeLlama exceeded the methods that provided direct feedback from Bandit or other feedback mechanisms.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Using the PythonSecurityEval dataset for evaluation, the analysis outcomes indicate that the FDSS method outperforms all baselines across three benchmarks and three models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, CodeLlama). The paper presents the percentage of secure codes generated in the PythonSecurityEval dataset by different methods and illustrates how different security issues, such as CWE-259 and CWE-20, are compared through graphical representations. Results show that the FDSS method has a significant improvement over other methods in generating secure code in most cases.

#### Summary
The article introduced a new approach to code refinement named FDSS, which, by integrating with the static code analysis tool, Bandit, significantly enhances the capability of LLMs in solving security issues within code.
