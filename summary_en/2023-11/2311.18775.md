#### Background
- **Background**
The article discusses the current status and challenges in the field of multimodal generation, specifically how to handle complex multimodal inputs and generate high-quality multimodal content.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research primarily focuses on improving the quality of generation for specific single modalities, such as image or text, and rarely addresses generation and interaction across multiple modalities. These methods generally fail to effectively handle multimodal input and lack flexibility to support multi-round interactive dialogues with users.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a multimodal generation model named CoDi-2**
    - **Challenge 1: Handling complex multimodal input**
      Current multimodal generation models often struggle with processing interleaved multimodal input effectively. CoDi-2 utilizes an MLLM (Multilingual Large Language Model) to process such inputs and autoregressively produce the latent features for multimodal generation, effectively addressing this challenge.

    - **Challenge 2: User-model multi-round interaction**
      Traditional models do not support multi-round, interactive dialogue content generation with users. CoDi-2 resolves this difficulty by understanding instructions within the context and supporting user interaction through multi-round conversations.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Compared to previous models, CoDi-2 demonstrated exceptional zero-shot and few-shot capabilities on tasks including style adaptation, subject-driven generation, and cross-modality editing. The model showcased strong generalization capabilities on new and unseen tasks in comprehensive evaluations. CoDi-2 represents a significant step in exploring the construction of a GPT-like foundational multimodal system.

#### Summary
CoDi-2 is an advanced multimodal generation model capable of processing complex multimodal inputs, guiding generation in-context, interacting with users through multi-round conversations, and achieving outstanding zero-shot and few-shot performance.
