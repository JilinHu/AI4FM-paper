#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses research on enhancing summarization performance through transformer-based prompt engineering in automated medical reporting.

- **Existing Work**
The existing work did not fully explore the causal relationship between the formulation detail of the prompt and the performance of automated reports. There is a lack of knowledge on how to properly use different metrics to evaluate these models and to assess the performance of prompt engineering techniques in practice.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a transformer-based prompt engineering approach**
    - **Challenge 1: How to improve the performance of automated medical reports**
      The study explored improving prompts by combining shot-prompting technology with context pattern prompting to enhance the performance of automated medical reporting. Results indicate that adding examples to the prompt is beneficial to the report, and adding both scope context and domain context can improve the performance of automated medical reports.

    - **Challenge 2: How to evaluate automated medical reports**
      For evaluating the automated medical reports, the ROUGE evaluation metric and human assessment were used. Although ROUGE is a common metric in text summarization assessments, the study points out its limitations and suggests that future work needs to create new evaluation metrics that account not only for the occurrence of words but also for the semantics of the automated medical report.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The study used self-written prompt engineering software with the support of the Azure OpenAI Service to run the GPT-4 model to produce automated medical reports. The generated reports were then evaluated against a human reference provided by a GP. Experimental results showed that a prompt's best overall structure was obtained by adding two examples along with scope and domain context, which resulted in the best-performing automated medical reports.

#### Summary
This research validated that applying transformer-based prompt engineering in automated medical reporting can improve summarization performance. Despite some limitations, the proposed approach has shown the effectiveness of including examples and contextual information in prompt formulations and pointed out directions for future work.
