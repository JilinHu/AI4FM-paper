#### Background
- **Background**
The paper introduces how Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the Natural Language Processing (NLP) landscape. Nowadays, the pre-training and prompting paradigm has replaced the traditional pre-training and fine-tuning approach for many downstream NLP tasks. This shift has been made possible, to a large extent, due to LLMs and the development of innovative prompting techniques. LLMs have shown great promise for a variety of downstream tasks because of their vast parameters and huge datasets on which they have been pre-trained. However, in order to fully harness their potential, their outputs must be guided toward the desired outcomes. Prompting, which involves providing a specific input or instruction to guide the LLMs toward the intended output, has become a tool to achieve this goal.

- **Existing Work**
Although prompting techniques have been significant in guiding the outputs of LLMs, they have not been fully utilized with many open problems still remaining. Traditional pre-training and fine-tuning methods are not adaptable to the massive scale of LLMs, and fine-tuning for every task becomes impractical. Prompting techniques have brought a new method to LLMs that allows minimum to no additional training to effectively guide. However, there is no definitive conclusion on how to fully and systematically harness prompting techniques.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a taxonomy and concise survey of prompting techniques for LLMs**
    - **Challenge 1: Accuracy and efficiency in guiding LLMs to desired outcomes**
        The paper points out that although prompting techniques can efficiently guide LLMs to the intended outputs, many current techniques still have limitations. By categorizing and surveying the existing literature, the paper reveals the diversity of current prompting techniques and analyzes how to better harness these techniques to improve the performance of LLMs across a variety of tasks. 

    - **Challenge 2: Innovation and optimization of prompting techniques**
        The paper acknowledges that despite some progress, the full potential of prompting has not been realized. It identifies open problems in the field of prompting techniques, which will serve as significant future directions for research that requires further innovation and exploration.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Although the paper summarized and categorized current prompting techniques for LLMs, it does not provide specific experimental results or comparisons with other works. The primary contribution of the paper is the overview it provided of current research and the identification of open problems and future directions for the field.

#### Summary
This paper provides a succinct literature review in the field of prompting for autoregressive large language models, highlighting unresolved challenges and open problems, thereby offering directions for future research.
