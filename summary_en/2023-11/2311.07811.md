#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses large language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities regarding syntactic consistency. It points out that LLMs may not always reliably handle tasks involving syntactic structures, especially when discerning logical relations between sentences, which is significant for understanding how LLMs learn and process the deep structure of language.

- **Existing Work**
The existing research often focuses on the quality and style of language generation tasks performed by LLMs without much consideration for the models' understanding of syntactic structures. Also, current studies have not delved deeply into the generalization capabilities of LLMs when performing syntactic transformation tasks, such as judging logical equivalence or containment between sentences with different syntactic structures.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a method to assess LLMs' capabilities in understanding syntactic structures**
      - **Challenge 1: Assessing LLMs' generalization in syntactic transformation tasks**
        The paper proposes an assessment method to address this challenge. It introduces a series of judgment tasks that require models to evaluate the correctness of sentences after syntactic transformations, such as tense reinflection. These tasks are designed to probe models' understanding of sentence structures and their fault-tolerance. The paper uses different prompt formats and pre-training data types to test these tasks and provides thorough analysis.
      - **Challenge 2: Exploring the impact of different models and training data on performance**
        The paper further explores how different model architectures and pre-training strategies (including models pre-trained with code) affect LLMs' abilities to handle syntactic structure tasks. Results show that certain patterns perform better in tasks, but this performance may hinge on specific heuristic rules rather than a true understanding of syntactic structures.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experimental results of the paper indicate that by considering syntactic components within a sentence (such as subjects, verbs, and their associations), some large language models achieve high reasoning accuracy and faithfulness scores in performing specific syntactic tasks. However, models show significant variance in accuracy when dealing with "non-entailment" sentences, suggesting a reliance on syntactic heuristics when using chain-of-thought prompts. The paper emphasizes that although some models approximate syntactic reasoning through specific rules, the accuracy significantly decreases in atypical or counterintuitive examples.

#### Summary
This paper unveils potential limitations of large language models in understanding and generalizing syntactic structures, which is crucial for improving the way language models handle complex syntactic tasks.
