#### Background
- **Background**
This paper proposes a solution for collaborative task planning in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs). In MAS, decision-making is a challenging issue since each agent can only gather partial observations of the state and needs to learn a decision policy to maximize cumulative rewards, a process which can be formalized as a Goal-Augmented Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (GA-Dec-POMDP).

- **Existing Work**
Existing work primarily focuses on improving the efficiency of MAS under specific conditions, such as enhancing planning and coordination with imitation or rule-based systems or simplifying decision processes with centralized control structures. However, these methods continue to face challenges in larger-scale and more complex situations, especially in long-term planning, mathematical reasoning, spatial reasoning, and learning from mistakes.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introducing an LLaMAC framework**
    - **Challenge 1: How to provide an effective structured and modular approach for LLM-based agents in understanding large-scale decision-making contexts?**
      The challenge arises from the need to convert complex, partially observable state information into text forms that LLMs can process and enable agents to make efficient decisions. LLaMAC addresses this by employing a Centralized Critic with Decentralized Actor (CCDA) structure, dividing the decision process into execution, storage, and critic modules, enhancing the overall systemâ€™s decision quality and efficiency.

    - **Challenge 2: How to maintain effective decision-making and planning when increasing the number of agents, controlling access costs, and reducing hallucination phenomena?**
      With an increasing number of agents, the frequency of hallucinations rises, and access costs get higher, requiring a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. LLaMAC introduces a TripletCritic mechanism providing an internal feedback loop with two critics of different preferences and an assessor to balance exploration and exploitation, while also considering efficient token usage and lowering access costs.

#### Implementation and Deployment
LLaMAC was evaluated in different Grid Transportation scenarios and compared with the state-of-the-art method HMAS-2. The results show that LLaMAC has a significantly higher success rate in complex iterative decision-making scenarios and completes tasks with fewer interaction steps relative to HMAS-2. Additionally, the TripletCritic mechanism produces higher-quality initial suggestions, reducing the need for feedback iterations and significantly improving token utilization efficiency.

#### Summary
The LLaMAC framework demonstrates superior performance of LLM-based multi-agent systems in long-term planning, mathematical reasoning, optimization problems, and spatial reasoning, while also reducing access costs for large-scale multi-agent collaboration. With further enhancement of LLMs and more collaboration frameworks emerging, new opportunities will unfold in the multi-agent collaboration field.
