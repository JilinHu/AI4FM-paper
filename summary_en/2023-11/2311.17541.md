#### Background
- **Background**
The article discussed the limitations of existing Language Models (LLMs) frameworks in handling domain-specific data analytics tasks and working with rich data structures. Furthermore, they lack the flexibility needed to meet various user requirements.

- **Existing Work**
Current frameworks struggle to efficiently handle complex data structures such as nested lists, dictionaries, or data frames, especially regarding information transfer between chat rounds or across different plugins. They also lack the capability to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the planning and code-generation process, posing a challenge in satisfying specific domain requirements. Additionally, the inflexibility of these frameworks makes it difficult to seamlessly incorporate plugin execution with custom code execution for ad-hoc user queries.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a code-first framework named TaskWeaver**
  - **Challenge 1: Dealing with complex data structures and information transfer across chat rounds**
      TaskWeaver transforms user requests into executable code and treats user-defined plugins as callable functions, offering support for rich data structures, flexible plugin usage, and dynamic plugin selection.

  - **Challenge 2: Integrating domain-specific knowledge**
      TaskWeaver incorporates domain-specific knowledge through examples, ensuring the safe execution of generated code and providing a robust and flexible framework for creating intelligent conversational agents capable of handling complex tasks and adapting to domain-specific scenarios.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The TaskWeaver framework includes key components such as a Planner, Code Generator (CG), and Code Executor (CE). It converts user requests into executable code while maintaining execution state during runtime. Experimental results show that TaskWeaver is highly effective in handling various tasks, inclusive of complex data structures, and exhibits adaptability to specific domains. The code has been made open-source on GitHub.

#### Summary
TaskWeaver is a code-first designed framework to build LLM-powered autonomous agents, achieving efficient handling of complex data structures, flexible plugin usage, and the successful integration of domain-specific knowledge into the system.
