#### Background
- **Background**        
The paper discusses the issue of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, particularly in the field of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). MBR selects the sequence with the highest expected utility as the output, contrasting with the more commonly used Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decision rule, and has shown better performance in a variety of tasks. However, the standard sampling-based MBR algorithm is computationally expensive, requiring a large number of samples and a quadratic number of utility function calls, limiting its applicability.

- **Existing Work**
    Existing MBR algorithms are limited in computational efficiency, requiring numerous samples and utility function calls. Even though there has been research devoted to finding more accurate and efficient generation methods and pruning the hypothesis set H to a smaller size with a faster method before executing standard MBR, existing methods are still insufficient to overcome the computation cost issue.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a confidence-based hypothesis pruning algorithm**
    - **Challenge 1: Insufficient Computational Efficiency**
        Challenge Explanation: MBR decoding becomes prohibitively expensive in many cases because it requires tens of thousands of samples and quadratic utility function calls, especially when the utility function itself is a deep neural model. The method proposed in the paper addresses this challenge by pruning underperforming hypotheses while gradually increasing the number of samples used to estimate utilities. This is done based on confidence estimates obtained with bootstrap sampling, thereby significantly reducing the number of calls to the utility function.

    - **Challenge 2: Maintaining Accuracy**
        Challenge Explanation: While it is necessary to reduce computational costs, decoding accuracy must also be maintained. The iterative pruning algorithm proposed in the paper manages to maintain statistically indistinguishable levels of accuracy compared to the standard MBR while reducing calls to the utility function, as evidenced by NMT experiments on three language pairs using chrF++ and COMET as utility/evaluation metrics.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The confidence-based algorithm proposed by the authors not only reduces the sample size applicable for MBR but also reduces the utility function calls by at least a factor of 7 on chrF++ and 15 on COMET. Furthermore, the algorithm can use fewer samples to make a prediction by terminating early, unlike the standard MBR. Experiments conducted on three language pairs demonstrated the efficacy of the method, proving that it can maintain accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

#### Summary
The paper presented an algorithm for MBR decoding that reduces utility function calls by gradually increasing the number of samples in the estimate and using confidence pruning. The algorithm significantly lowers computational costs while maintaining accuracy, and its effectiveness was validated through NMT experiments on three language pairs.
