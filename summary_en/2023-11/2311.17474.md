#### Background
- **Background**
The article presents the application background of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the networking field, emphasizing their roles and potentials in enhancing network intelligence. The authors highlight the growing complexity of existing network technologies and the necessity of more intelligent methods for management and optimization, where LLMs can play a key technological role.

- **Existing Work**
Previous research in network technology applications has seldom focused on integrating language models to improve the capabilities of network design, planning, and operation. Existing networks struggle to handle rapidly evolving networks and complex data types (including text, images, specific coding). Also, the quick evolution of network technologies and protocols poses challenges for traditional models to stay relevant; there is a need for continuous update of the datasets to maintain model relevance.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a conceptual framework called ChatNet**
    - **Challenge 1: Integrating multimodal data and maintaining model relevance**
        The integration of multimodal data and maintaining long-term relevance of the model are challenges for constructing multimodal network LLMs. The paper suggests the need for complex training processes and continuous updates of training data to overcome these issues. The paper addresses this challenge by building and optimizing large language models and making them domain-adapted to handle a mix of various data types.

    - **Challenge 2: Developing network LLM plugins**
        The challenge in plugin development is to create solutions that are flexible enough to accommodate a variety of network architectures and targeted enough to provide meaningful insights and actions. The paper discusses the ChatNet framework, whose plugins attempt to extend the LLM capabilities, allowing them to interact more effectively with various network components and systems, enhancing network management and design.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The article demonstrates a case study by simulating a ChatNet prototype supported by GPT-4, showing the actual application of the four models: analyzer, planner, calculator, and executor. The experimental results indicate that the analyzer consistently achieved a score higher than 0.8 with no human intervention required, while the calculator was the bottleneck of the framework, needing multiple human interventions. When the RAG method was employed, the calculator was able to extract mathematical constraints and provide a basically correct model. Additionally, the planner's performance could be improved to some extent with the CoT (Chain of Thought) approach.

#### Summary
The paper proposes a new framework, ChatNet, that integrates Large Language Models with network technologies, exploring its application in network planning. The study demonstrates that ChatNet can effectively promote the automation and intelligence level of network tasks, though challenges such as multimodal data integration and plugin development must be addressed prior to deployment.
