#### Background
- **Background**
This paper introduces the concept of "Prompting Framework" and provides a comprehensive and systematic review of existing prompting frameworks. It presents categorizations, comparative analyses, and evaluation criteria, assesses their applicability and limitations, and offers practical recommendations for their effective use in real-world tasks involving Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, the paper discusses useful toolkits related to prompts that fall beyond the scope of Prompting Frameworks. It also presents recommendations for future research. In summary, the main contributions are the introduction of the concept of Prompting Frameworks, which have garnered attention in academia and industry, and the provision of systematic and standardized definitions and terminology.

- **Existing Work**
Current Prompting Frameworks do not fully address key issues such as compatibility with programming languages, the capacity of LLMs to leverage external tools, and the maintenance of historical interaction information. Prompting Frameworks somewhat mitigate the frequency of LLM invocations and the number of tokens processed through Memory systems and text manipulation techniques, but they generally lack functionality to reduce the cost of LLM invocation. Moreover, the capability of LLMs to integrate external tools across different domains is also shown to be insufficient, indicating an immature stage of enabling LLMs to use external tools.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a systematic and comprehensive definition and description of the Prompting Framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Enhancing the compatibility and capabilities of LLMs in practical applications**
      Current Prompting Frameworks have not resolved compatibility issues with programming languages and the ability of LLMs to use external tools in practical applications. The paper's solution includes the implementation of Memory systems and text manipulation techniques.

    - **Challenge 2: Maintenance of historical interaction information**
      LLMs typically only process the current context information provided in the prompt, lacking the capability to maintain and store historical interaction information. The proposed solution with enhanced Memory systems addresses this challenge.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The proposed Prompting Framework includes compatibility with programming languages, capacity for LLMs to utilize external tools, and ability to maintain historical interaction information. Deployment methods comprise command-line installation, a custom interactive user interface, and a "plug-and-play" approach directly on the interface provided by LLMs. In terms of availability, the examined prompting frameworks offer extensive technical documentation covering almost all features and use cases. They also provide detailed example code, tutorials, and operation guides.

#### Summary
This research delivers a framework that enhances interaction with LLMs by implementing new techniques, including improved compatibility with programming languages, enabling LLMs to utilize external tools, and maintaining historical interaction information, thus guiding future research directions.
