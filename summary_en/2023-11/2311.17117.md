#### Background
- **Background**
    The article touches on the objective of character animation, which aims to generate character videos from still images using control signals. While diffusion models have become a mainstream approach in visual generation research due to their robust generative capabilities, persisting challenges in image-to-video synthesis, especially in character animation regarding temporal consistency with detailed character information, are formidable problems.

- **Existing Work**
    Existing research has started to explore human image-to-video tasks by leveraging the architecture of diffusion models and their trained capabilities. However, they still fall short in maintaining character details and overcoming inter-frame jitter. Moreover, current character animation research is largely task-specific, leading to limited generalization capabilities. Even though recent advances in text-to-image have led to significant progress in related fields like text-to-video and video editing, these methods often lack the precision needed for maintaining fine-grained details of characters over time when applied to character animation, leading to temporal inconsistencies.


#### Core Contributions
  - **Proposed a framework named "Animate Anyone"**
    - **Challenge 1: Maintaining appearance consistency**
        To address the consistency of intricate appearance features from reference images, the researchers designed a system called ReferenceNet, which merges feature details via spatial attention. ReferenceNet, with its symmetrical UNet structure, captures spatial details of the reference image and integrates its features with the denoising UNet utilizing spatial attention. This architecture significantly improves the ability to maintain appearance details and ensures comprehensive learning of the relationship with the reference image in a consistent feature space.

    - **Challenge 2: Ensuring controllability and continuity**
        A lightweight pose guider was introduced to integrate pose control signals into the denoising process, ensuring the controllability of character movements. Additionally, for temporal stability, a temporal layer was introduced to model the relationships across multiple frames. This ensures high-resolution detail in visual quality while simulating a continuous and smooth temporal motion process.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The method was trained on an internal dataset containing 5K character video clips. By comparison with previous methods, it effectively maintains spatial and temporal consistency of character appearance in videos, produces high-definition videos without temporal jitter or flickering issues, and can animate any character image into a video without domain constraints. Evaluations on the UBC fashion video dataset and TikTok dataset indicated that the approach achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating superior capabilities in character animation compared to general image-to-video approaches trained on large-scale data.

#### Summary
The paper presents a new framework "Animate Anyone" using diffusion models for character animation. The framework maintains appearance consistency through ReferenceNet and ensures controllability and continuity of animations via a pose guider and temporal layer, achieving advanced results in character animation generation.
