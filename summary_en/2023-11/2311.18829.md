#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses the challenges in the text-to-video generation domain, highlighting difficulties such as insufficient handling of fine-grained appearance details and low efficiency in learning motion dynamics when generating videos directly from text prompts.

- **Existing Work**
Current methods attempt to learn directly through large-scale text-to-video diffusion models, which, while capable of producing high-quality videos, require substantial GPU resources and extensive training data. Some works propose a more cost-effective strategy by introducing temporal layers into a text-to-image model and then fine-tuning on paired text and video data to create a text-to-video model; however, the generated videos may have appearance and temporal coherence issues.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a framework called MicroCinema**
  - **Challenge 1: Appearance Preservation and Temporal Coherence**
      To address the challenge of appearance preservation and temporal coherence, the paper proposes a divide-and-conquer strategy that splits the text-to-video generation process into two stages: text-to-image generation and image&text-to-video generation. By leveraging a keyframe image generated by any off-the-shelf text-to-image generator and then generating the video based on that image and text, the proposed Appearance Injection Network enhances image appearance preservation and allows the model to focus on learning motion.

  - **Challenge 2: Utilizing Advanced Text-to-Image Models**
      The paper takes advantage of advanced text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALLÂ·E to generate photorealistic and detailed images. This allows MicroCinema to focus less on appearance details and more on efficient motion dynamics learning in subsequent video generation stages. Additionally, the newly introduced Appearance Noise Prior mechanism aims to maintain the capabilities of pre-trained 2D diffusion models.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Through extensive experiments, MicroCinema demonstrates the superiority of its framework. Specifically, on a zero-shot learning condition, MicroCinema achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot FVD scores of 342.86 on UCF-101 and 377.40 on MSR-VTT datasets, both of which are the best current results.

#### Summary
MicroCinema, with its innovative two-phase process for text-to-video generation and effective Appearance Injection Network and Appearance Noise Prior mechanisms, has achieved a breakthrough in video generation quality, serving as a reference model for subsequent work.
