#### Background
- **Background**
The article discusses the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, particularly through data-driven personalized learning solutions. Despite the advantages such as individualized feedback and interactive modules offered by current intelligent educational systems, developing AI tutors that can provide consistently accurate and reliable answers across various academic disciplines remains a challenge.

- **Existing Work**
Existing intelligent tutoring systems are limited by their architecture relying on predefined rules and databases, often failing to generate answers for questions outside of their database or lacking reasoning skills. Even with advanced natural language processing, systems that adhere to a fixed question bank are constrained in answer flexibility and have low tolerance for linguistic errors, displaying limitations in accommodating poorly structured questions. These constraints highlight the main shortcomings of previous AI tutor systems that cannot effectively handle open-ended student inputs.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introducing a new web application called AI Tutor**
  - **Challenge 1: Generating accurate and educationally cogent feedback**
    To overcome the limitations of existing systems and provide more precise and personalized tutoring support, AI Tutor uses state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. By digesting and integrating course materials, AI Tutor constructs an adaptive knowledge base that retrieves the most relevant information and generates detailed conversational feedback, citing supporting evidence when students pose questions.

  - **Challenge 2: Providing teaching support adaptable to various subjects**
    AI Tutor demonstrates its versatility across different subjects and its capability to produce educationally sound responses. The system showcases its multifunctionality and adaptability through a fully functional web interface and video demonstration.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper presents AI Tutor as a prototype web application that integrates advanced large language models and retrieval-augmented generation techniques to produce accurate and natural question answering. In its implementation, the system features a user-friendly web interface that allows uploading course materials and submitting queries. It utilizes robust vector embedding and storage systems for educational content, employs similarity-based retrieval algorithms to identify relevant information, and leverages OpenAI's Assistants API for optimized answer generation.

#### Summary
This paper represents an innovative attempt to build an AI tutor system that can adapt to any course subject and provide customized high-quality educational support, potentially progressing the application of AI technology in education and forging a new path for the development of AI tutoring systems.
