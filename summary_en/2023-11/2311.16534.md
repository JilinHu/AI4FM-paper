#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses challenges and opportunities in integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with graph data, a crucial area that is still in its infancy compared to its advancements in natural language processing and computer vision.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work does not adequately address the distinct challenges of applying AGI to graph data, especially regarding how to make models generally applicable across different modalities, domains, and tasks.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Unified Framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Understanding graph prompt learning**
      The paper proposes a first-of-its-kind unified framework to illuminate the understanding of prompt tokens, token structures, and insertion patterns in the graph domain, providing clarity for graph prompt learning.
   
    - **Challenge 2: Systematically categorizing the field's work**
      A comprehensive taxonomy is introduced, documenting over 100 works in this domain, and aligning them with pre-training tasks at the node-level, edge-level, and graph-level.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper presents ProG, a Python library, and an accompanying website, which aims to support and enhance research in graph prompting. This work offers a guide for further exploration and practical applications of AGI in graph data, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize the AGI domain and beyond.

#### Summary
This paper provides a thorough survey on graph prompt learning, covering the AGI challenges with graph data handling and how graph prompt learning can facilitate cross-modality, cross-domain, and cross-task applicability of AGI technologies.
