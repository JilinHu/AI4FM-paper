#### Background
- **Background**
The paper investigates how cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) perform in tasks of reconstructing original texts and answering questions from scrambled datasets.

- **Existing Work**
Previous studies might have encountered data contamination issues—where test data inadvertently became part of the training set—and lacked a clear distinction in evaluating whether LLMs truly understand the original or distorted text or just memorized the content.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Proposed an evaluation method based on scrambled statements**
    - **Challenge 1: Scrambled Text Recognition**
        To simulate true natural language scrambling and ensure no data contamination during evaluation, the team used the most recent RealtimeQA dataset, building various scramble types (random scramble, keep first letter, keep first and last letters) to assess the models' abilities in different scramble scenarios. The challenge was to ensure the evaluation system was assessing the language models' genuine problem-solving capabilities rather than their memory.
    - **Challenge 2: Measuring Performance**
        The study defined two metrics: Recovery Rate (RR) and Relative Performance Gain (RPG). RR quantifies the proportion of edit distance reduction in recovered texts, while RPG assesses the models' comprehension of scrambled texts compared to original texts. The challenge was to create a fair comparison benchmark, not influenced by the models' varying capabilities on original questions.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper's experiments evaluated a range of both closed-source and open-source LLMs, including the latest versions of text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4. Key findings demonstrate that GPT-4 consistently maintained a recovery rate over 95%, showing superior performance over other models even as the scramble rate increased. These outcomes attest to GPT-4's excellence in handling non-natural scrambled texts.

#### Summary
The research showcased GPT-4's robust capabilities in managing scrambled texts, set forth new metrics RR and RPG, and validated GPT-4's stable performance across various scramble scenarios and rates.
