#### Background
- **Background**
    The paper discusses the significant strides large language models (LLMs) have made in reasoning and decision-making skills, and their ability to have natural conversations with users. However, they are still limited by their inability to access knowledge beyond their training, exhibit limited math and computational skills, and interact with the external world. Recent works propose augmenting LLM-based assistants with external tools to access private or recent information and perform actions for users.

- **Existing Work**
    Existing works proposed chatbots powered by LLM that can use tools like search engines, calculators, or web APIs. To make significant advancements in tool use, relevant benchmarks and evaluation datasets that challenge these systems with realistic scenarios are required. Due to the lack of benchmarks that adequately simulate typical interactions users may have with tool-using assistants, this paper presents ToolTalk to address this need.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced the ToolTalk benchmark**
    - **Challenge 1: Evaluating assistant performance in tool usage within a conversational setting**
      ToolTalk includes 28 tools organized into 7 plugins, each with a full simulated implementation, allowing for fully automated evaluation of assistants based on execution feedback. The benchmark emphasizes tools that affect the external world rather than those for reference or information searching. The evaluation method is tailored to the specifics of the dataset, going beyond common metrics like exact-match accuracy. It separates evaluations for action tools and non-action tools and uses tool invocation recall and incorrect action rate as primary metrics within a conversational turn, defining a conversation-level success criterion.

    - **Challenge 2: Creating a dataset that meets the needs of realistic conversations**
      To simulate typical conversations a user might have with an LLM-based assistant, ToolTalk is designed as conversational and allows for multiple rounds of dialogue between the user and the assistant for a single intent. This approach caters to users' realistic interaction with their assistants, reflecting that they may not always express their full request in one utterance and can add qualifiers or corrections after some feedback from the assistant. ToolTalk includes 78 conversations with a total of 178 turns using 28 unique tools spread across 7 categories.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experiments evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using ToolTalk, resulting in conversation-level success rates of 26% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that tool usage within a conversational setting is still challenging for even the most advanced models. Error analyses from ToolTalk reveal major categories of mistakes and suggest directions for future improvement.

#### Summary
ToolTalk is a benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the performance of LLMs in utilizing multi-step external tools within a conversational context. With innovative evaluation methods and realistic scenario simulations, it challenges and expands the boundaries of LLM capabilities and charts a course for future research.
