#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the potential of systematic prompt engineering to guide generalist foundation models like GPT-4 towards specialist-level capabilities in medicine without needing special fine-tuning or reliance on human expert intervention for prompt construction.

- **Existing Work**
Existing studies have focused on employing generic large language models for specialized tasks, attempting to enhance their capabilities through fine-tuning or designing specific input prompts. However, these methods have not been able to efficiently elevate the performance of foundation models to an expert level in specialized tasks without expert supervision.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a strategy named Medprompt**
    - **Challenge 1: How to adapt the foundation model to specific domain inquiries without relying on specialized training data or manually designed prompts?**
        The challenge lies in efficiently selecting a few-shot examples that allow the foundation model to rapidly adapt to the task format. Medprompt uses dynamic example selection and self-generated chains of thought strategy to enable the model to choose different prompt examples based on test samples, thereby better fitting various task inputs.

    - **Challenge 2: How to quantify and enhance the method's universality to ensure it is effective beyond medicine in other disciplines?**
        By demonstrating Medprompt's performance in competency evaluations across multiple disciplines, including electrical engineering, computer science, philosophy, accounting, law, nursing, and clinical psychology, the study highlights that this approach is not only valid for medical QA datasets but also performs well in competition problems in various fields, underscoring the generality and extensibility of the method.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The Medprompt methodology combines three major techniques: dynamic few-shot, self-generated chain of thought, and choice shuffle ensembling. Experiments demonstrate that this strategy significantly enhances the professional capabilities of the GPT-4 model on medical challenges, surpassing expert models that were previously tailored with specialized fine-tuning and assisted with expert-crafted prompts. Specifically, Medprompt achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 90% on the benchmark medical QA datasets, setting a new record for best performance.

The uniqueness of Medprompt lies in its use of foundation models to create their own powerful chain of thought prompts, which outperform traditional expert-crafted prompts. The paper further analyzes the relative importance of the different components of Medprompt through ablation studies. Additionally, by evaluating the strategy using an eyes-off dataset, the study avoids overfitting issues, and by testing the performance of these prompting strategies across disciplines beyond medicine, it demonstrates its universality and potential.

#### Summary
This paper explores how to guide a generalist foundation model to exhibit expert-level capabilities on specialized tasks without expert supervision, using the medical field as a case study. The proposed Medprompt strategy proves to have a significant advantage in enhancing the specialized abilities of foundation models and shows the possibility of widespread application across multiple disciplines.
