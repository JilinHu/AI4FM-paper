#### Background
- **Background**
The article discusses how Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) are reshaping the field of Software Engineering (SE). Although GPTs enable innovative methods for many SE tasks such as automated code generation, debugging, maintenance, etc., a limited number of existing works have thoroughly explored the potential of GPT agents in SE.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research has investigated the role of GPT-based agents in SE and their application, benefits, and complexities in autonomously generating various SE tasks. The limitation of existing work is that most of it has been confined to case studies, focusing primarily on users' perceptions in coding and writing. The article points out that although GPT models have found applications across various aspects of SE due to their expertise in NLP, challenges such as ensuring code correctness, maintenance, and bridging the gap between natural language and programming semantics remain significant issues.

#### Core Contributions
- **Proposed a collaboration framework of multiple GPT-agents**
    - **Challenge 1: High-quality code generation and maintenance**
        Existing studies show that GPT models have the potential in various aspects of SE, but these models have mostly focused on code generation and auto-completion. The article's proposed approach of multiple GPT agents can execute creative and demanding tasks much beyond coding and debugging, including project planning, requirements engineering, and software design, as evidenced by initial results on simple software such as the Snake Game, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Notepad.

    - **Challenge 2: Enhancing intelligent language understanding and generation abilities**
        While the natural language generation capabilities of GPT models have been successfully applied to multiple SE tasks, how to further scale these autonomous abilities to meet the needs of specific software projects remains a challenge. The multi-agent framework in the article aims to revolutionize how software development teams operate, to improve code quality and enhance software reliability by leveraging the natural language understanding and generation capabilities of these agents for error identification, context understanding, automated reporting, and code fixes.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper provides a video link demonstrating the preliminary work. In their initial experimental analysis, multiple GPT agents have produced high-quality code for simple software (e.g., Snake Game, Tic-Tac-Toe, Notepad) and documented it meticulously. This indicates that using multiple GPT agents can result in unparalleled efficiency and dramatically reduce lead times. Although the article does not detail specific experimental results or compare with relevant work, it emphasizes the immense potential of the proposed method in the field of software development and the direction for future research.

#### Summary
This paper proposes a vision of using multiple GPT agents for automating SE tasks and showcases preliminary success in simple software tasks. This work has the potential to fundamentally change the way software development is conducted and to shorten development time.
