#### Background
- **Background**
This paper introduces the effectiveness of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in a broad range of general natural language processing (NLP) tasks and discusses the direct correlation found between the performance of these models and their size. Researchers have started referring to oversized PLMs as large language models (LLMs) which have recently grown considerably. A unique capability of LLMs is in-context learning (ICL), a specialized form of prompting that allows using LLMs for specific downstream tasks without altering the model parameters. Despite its interest, privacy concerns have surfaced as a significant barrier to its widespread adoption.

- **Existing Work**
Many studies have examined privacy risks associated with ICL and general prompting, proposing various techniques to mitigate these risks. Nevertheless, there is a need to organize these techniques to benefit the community.

#### Core Contributions
  - **A systematic overview**
    - **Challenge 1: Privacy Protection Issues**
      The challenge is implementing privacy protection methods during ICL and general prompting, especially when dealing with data that may comprise sensitive information. The paper reviews, analyzes, and compares different methods, and offers a summary of the resources available for developing these frameworks.

    - **Challenge 2: Framework limitations**
      The paper discusses the current limitations of these privacy protection frameworks and provides an in-depth examination of the promising areas that require further exploration.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The survey provides an overview of various methods employed for privacy protection during ICL and general prompting, including differential privacy (DP), sanitization, encryption, ensembling, etc., and discusses their application in LLMs. Notably, the paper presents a categorization system that classifies privacy frameworks into four main categories: non-DP, local DP, global DP, and others, and detailedly introduces privacy mechanisms and objectives for each category.

#### Summary
The survey paper contributes a systematic overview concerning privacy protection methods in the realm of ICL and general prompting with LLMs, facilitating further research and exploration within the community regarding privacy protection.
