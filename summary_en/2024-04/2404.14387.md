#### Background
- **Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs) have made breakthrough advancements in various fields and intelligent agent applications. However, as tasks increase in complexity and diversity, current LLMs that learn from human or external model supervision may encounter a performance ceiling.

- **Existing Work**
Current LLMs struggle with complex tasks such as scientific discovery and forecasting future events due to inherent difficulties in existing training paradigms such as modeling, annotation, and evaluation. Furthermore, scaling model performance by adding more real-world data could be an imposing limitation for current LLMs.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a Conceptual Framework for Self-Evolution**
    - **Challenge 1: Building a system that can autonomously acquire and refine experiences**
        The paper presents a conceptual framework which segments the self-evolution process into four phases: experience acquisition, refinement, updating, and evaluation, thus enabling LLMs to evolve through iterative cycles.

    - **Challenge 2: Systematically organizing and analyzing the relationships between different self-evolution methods**
        The article collects and summarizes a vast literature on various self-evolution methods, providing taxonomy and insights to researchers, while pointing out existing challenges and proposing directions for the future to facilitate the development of self-evolving frameworks and the next generation of models.
    
#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper provides a comprehensive survey of self-evolutionary methods and introduces a conceptual framework for self-evolution. By addressing challenges like those presented by static data-bound models, the paper outlines open questions and suggests directions for future research. Although specific implementation and deployment details were not discussed in this part of the document, evaluation results suggest that models employing self-evolutionary frameworks, such as DeepMind's AMIE system and Microsoft's WizardLM-2, have outperformed the initial version of GPT-4.

#### Summary
The review paper offers a structured overview and summary of self-evolution approaches in LLMs, furnishing conceptual frameworks and future insights to propel research into self-evolving LLMs and pave the way for the development of next-generation models.
