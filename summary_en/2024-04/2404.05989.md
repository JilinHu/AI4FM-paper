#### Background
- **Background**
The embedding-based retrieval (EBR) approach is heavily used in mainstream search engine retrieval systems and plays a vital role in reducing LLM hallucinations. However, EBR models frequently suffer from the "semantic drift" issue, a lack of focus on key information leading to a minimal adoption rate of retrieval results, particularly in scenarios of real-time search where multiple expressions of popular events rely on critical event information.

- **Existing Work**
Prior research did not significantly address the difficulties specific to real-time search. Efforts to enhance embedded representation performance involve introducing more vast amounts of data and models with more extensive parameters or utilizing data augmentation techniques such as token duplication, replacement, etc. These methods poorly address events, the core part of real-time searches, and cannot handle the complexity of the scenario.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a novel method called EER**
      - **Challenge 1: "Semantic Drift" in Real-time Search**
          The "semantic drift" issue refers to the model encoding deviating from the context, lacking key information focus. The EER method addresses this challenge by combining contrastive and pairwise learning for encoder optimization to enable the encoder to concentrate better on sequence relationships, improving robustness.

      - **Challenge 2: High Asymmetry of Information Between Queries and Titles**
          To resolve the imbalance and noisy information in titles, the EER method innovatively incorporates a decoder structure post the document encoder. This structure processes encoded title information to extract event triplets through a generative task, making the title-side encoder focus more on event information.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The EER method, which enhances the traditional EBR dual encoder model, has demonstrated through experiments a significant improvement in retrieval performance for real-time searches. It uses contrastive learning and a generation task specialized for event titles, emphasizing the encoders' attention to event details. With supervised contrastive learning to bolster query encoder performance, the EER method eliminates the decoder module during inference, resulting in no latency impact, converting back to the traditional dual-tower model.

#### Summary
EER is an innovative approach targeting the "semantic drift" in real-time searches by enhancing the EBR model and including contrastive learning and a generative event triplet task. The method's effectiveness has been experimentally verified, potentially providing new insights into the information retrieval domain.
