#### Background
- **Background**
The paper introduces that existing pre-trained models without specific task tuning can often generate outputs with higher variability, including unwanted additional information not specified in prompts. In classification tasks, models sometimes generate the actual class strings like "Yes/No", "positive/negative", or "True/False" instead of the "1/0" labels present in the dataset even when instructions are given.

- **Existing Work**
The paper leverages LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning for models and points out that LoRA fine-tuning can provide consistent and significant performance improvements across base models and tasks. Before fine-tuning, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 showed the strongest out-of-the-box performance among all base models with overall scores of 0.599 and 0.661, respectively.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a method of fine-tuning LLMs through LoRA**
    - **Challenge 1: Inconsistent performance of out-of-the-box LLMs**
        The method to tackle this issue involves enhancing model performance through LoRA fine-tuning. After fine-tuning, the models significantly outperform GPT-3.5 on average and some of the 7B fine-tuned models even surpass GPT-4.
    
    - **Challenge 2: Expensive cost and resource constraints of fine-tuning pre-trained models**
        The paper mentions that using costly LLM APIs like GPT-4 to evaluate the complete WikiSQL test sets would be financially draining, costing approximately $400. Thus, to manage costs while ensuring rigor, evaluations were limited to the first 1000 examples for datasets with over 1000 examples, although this might introduce selection bias and affect the generalizability of the findings.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Based on Table 2 in the paper, models are evaluated on the test split. A tailored set of evaluation metrics is employed to accurately assess performance across all tasks. Accuracy is used for classification tasks, (1 - mean absolute error) for regression tasks, and rouge-L for generation tasks. The paper also uses specific evaluation suites and regex-based heuristic methods to assess the quality of code generation and mathematical problem-solving. All metrics are scored on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 being the worst possible score.
The paper shows that LoRA fine-tuning provides a consistent and significant lift from fine-tuning across base models and tasks, with Mistral-7B and Zephyr-7b-beta emerging as leaders in LoRA fine-tuning performance.

#### Summary
This paper proposes that fine-tuning large language models through LoRA can significantly improve the overall performance of the models, reduce errors in classification tasks, and outperform out-of-the-box models like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Additionally, the paper takes into account cost constraints, reducing the financial burden of using LLM APIs by limiting the number of evaluation samples.
