#### Background
- **Background**
The paper introduces the key role of query rewriting in modern database systems. Traditional query rewrite techniques focus on rule-based methods, necessary for ensuring the executability and equivalence of the rewritten queries. However, existing methods are still limited in finding the optimal choice or sequence of rewrite rules and often costly in terms of resources. New rewrite rule discovery often requires complex structural logic proofs or extensive user interaction. Furthermore, current query rewrite methods highly depend on often inaccurate DBMS cost estimators.

- **Existing Work**
Existing studies have concentrated on rule-based rewriting techniques by discovering new rewrite rules or effectively applying existing ones. For instance, Learned Rewrite utilizes existing rewrite rules from the Apache Calcite platform and learns to select appropriate rules. Nevertheless, the challenges include the computational demand of the Monte Carlo algorithm and the accuracy of the cost estimation model. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has also introduced methods for direct query rewriting.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introducing LLM-R2, a Large Language Model Enhanced Rule-based Rewrite System**
    - **Challenge 1: Automating Rule Selection and Reducing Resource Consumption**
        The system uses a large language model (LLM) to propose possible rewrite rules, automating the process of selecting more effective rewrite rules while ensuring the executability and equivalence of the rewritten query.

    - **Challenge 2: Overcoming Hallucination and Improving Execution Efficiency**
        To tackle hallucination and boost execution efficiency, the authors developed a pool of effective query rewrites and a contrastive model for selecting the most beneficial in-context demonstration for guiding the system and optimizing LLM's rule selection. Furthermore, to address the limited training data, they proposed using a learning curriculum technique to schedule training data.

#### Implementation and Deployment
LLM-R2 demonstrated significant improvements in query execution efficiency when applied to three different datasets (TPC-H, IMDB, and DSB). Compared to the original query times, the method required only 52.5%, 56.0%, and 39.8% of the querying time, and reduced to 94.5%, 63.1%, and 40.7% when compared with the state-of-the-art baseline method, respectively.

#### Summary
LLM-R2 is an LLM-enhanced query rewrite system that effectively boosts the execution efficiency of query rewriting by automatically selecting effective rules from a given set of rewrite rules. It addresses the limitations of current methods and shows superior performance across multiple datasets.
