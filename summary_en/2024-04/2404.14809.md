#### Background
- **Background**
The article introduces the concept of graphs as fundamental data models representing various entities and their complex relationships in society and nature, such as social networks, transportation networks, financial networks, and biomedical systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant generalization abilities in handling various natural language processing (NLP) and multi-modal tasks, answering arbitrary questions, and generating domain-specific content.

- **Existing Work**
Compared to graph learning models, LLMs have limitations, such as the need for retraining for different graph tasks and limited transferability between different graph tasks. LLMs have an advantage in generalizing graph tasks, including eliminating the training of graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation.

#### Core Contributions
- **Conducted a comprehensive survey of existing LLM research on graph data**
    - **Challenge 1: Generalization challenge of graph tasks**
        LLMs can address this challenge by eliminating the need for training graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation.
        
    - **Challenge 2: How to use LLMs to solve graph tasks**
        The survey delves deeply into and summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing challenges and future research directions.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The survey thoroughly evaluates the applications of LLM in graph data analytics, including LLM-based graph query processing, LLM-based graph inference and learning, and graph-LLM-based applications. It compares the superior performance of LLMs within the concept of graph foundational models with the limitations of graph learning models and outlines future research directions.

#### Summary
This work is a survey that investigates research on LLMs applied to graph data, discusses the advantages of LLMs in providing general solutions for graph tasks, and suggests future directions for research in this field.
