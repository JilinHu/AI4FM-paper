#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses the issue of constraining the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to follow specific formats or standards. This is particularly important for developers since it would help reduce the repetitive and time-consuming task of developing, testing, and integrating LLM prompts, and benefit the user experience of using LLM features and applications.

- **Existing Work**
Existing works, such as instruction-tuning techniques, have significantly improved the chances of generating a valid JSON object upon user request, but the survey respondents believe that this is not enough as they desire to have more precise control over the outputs.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a tool**
  - **Challenge 1: Output Constraints**
        The survey found that industry professionals' need for output constraints is diversified, which can be categorized into low-level and high-level constraints. The low-level constraints ensure that model outputs adhere to a specific structure like JSON or Markdown, perform pure choice tasks (e.g., sentiment classification), or dictate the output length. In contrast, the high-level constraints require the model outputs to follow semantic (e.g., must include or exclude specific terms or actions) or stylistic (e.g., adhere to a certain style or tone) guidelines while preventing fabrication. The paper presents methods and concepts for implementing these constraints based on the analysis of use-case surveys.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The respondents believe that the ability to apply constraints to LLM outputs would result in benefits for both developers and users. For developers, it improves the prompt-based development efficiency, speeds up the design and engineering of prompts (less trial and error), reduces or eliminates specific parsing and plumbing logic, and saves the cost of requesting multiple candidates. For users, it helps to satisfy product and UI requirements, ensure consistency in output length and format, better integrate into downstream processes and workflows, improve user experience and trust, and increase customer satisfaction and adoption.

#### Summary
This paper explores how to implement user-centered constraints on the outputs of large language models (LLMs) by surveying industry professionals to understand different scenarios and demands. The focus is on enhancing the efficiency of developers in the development, testing, and integration process of LLMs, and on bolstering the end-user experience by meeting specific output formats and user interface requirements.
