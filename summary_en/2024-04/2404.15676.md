#### Background
- **Background**
The paper presents a comprehensive survey of Chain-of-X (CoX) methods applied in various domains and tasks involving Large Language Models (LLMs). It discusses the widespread adoption of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodology, which has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured problem-solving prompts.

- **Existing Work**
Current research primarily focuses on CoT, concentrating on providing explicit reasoning steps within a structured format. However, there has not been an exhaustive overview of CoX methods, leaving a gap in understanding their potential and nuances.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a comprehensive survey**
      - **Challenge 1: Limitations of CoT Methodologies**
        Although CoT has shown to be effective in enhancing LLMs' capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, CoX methods have not been categorized or collectively examined. This paper addresses this by offering a structured overview of existing CoX methods, categorizing them by nodes and application tasks, thereby providing deeper insights into the application of CoT concepts in a broader context.

      - **Challenge 2: Concept and Definition of CoX Methods**
         By outlining the foundational knowledge of CoT and extending its ideology to CoX, the paper defines CoX as a generalization of the CoT method for diverse LLM tasks. Through the concept of 'nodes' in the chain structure and the tasks involving LLMs in various algorithmic frameworks or structures, the paper offers a perspective on the adaptability and potential of CoX for tackling complex tasks.

#### Implementation and Deployment
In terms of implementation and deployment, the survey provides a definition of Chain-of-X and a summary of existing CoX methods' node types, aiding researchers in understanding how to adapt CoX methods to the diverse tasks of LLMs. For instance, the Chain-of-Verification framework addresses hallucinations by generating initial responses, composing a series of verification questions, and revising prior responses based on these questions. This method extends the logical progression of CoT to more complex problem resolution and output refinement.

#### Summary
The article is a detailed survey of Chain-of-X (CoX) methods in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on extending the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) concept to broader applications and providing potential directions for future research.
