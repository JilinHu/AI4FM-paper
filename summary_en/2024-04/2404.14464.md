#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses multi-hop question answering, a complex problem requiring knowledge-intensive reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their Chain of Thoughts (CoT) capability,  step through complex issues, while retrieval augmentation helps to mitigate factual errors due to outdated or unknown knowledge. However, existing chain methods lead to issues like irrelevant paragraph retrieval and error propagation.
- **Existing Work**
Existing work in this domain has focused on one-time retrieval methods that fall short in addressing the nuances of multi-hop questions. Iterative retrieves multi-turn guided by new sub-questions still suffer from the risk of cumulative errors, making them vulnerable in obtaining reliable knowledge.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Dynamic retrieval framework called TREE OF REVIEWS (TOR)**
    - **Challenge 1: Mitigating the effect of irrelevant paragraphs on reasoning processes**
        The paper introduces a tree structure to handle retrieved paragraphs independently, reducing the misleading influence of irrelevant paragraphs on reasoning paths and diminishing the impact of individual reasoning errors on the entire process.
    - **Challenge 2: Enhancing the efficiency and quality of iterative retrieval**
        The paper presents two tree-based search optimization strategies: pruning, which minimizes unproductive search initiations, and effective expansion, which refines query generation for better retrieval, providing valuable insights into the optimization of iterative retrieval.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Experiments conducted on three different multi-hop question answering datasets demonstrated TOR's state-of-the-art performance in both retrieval and response generation, validating its effectiveness. The proposed pruning strategy reduces unnecessary search initiations, while effective expansion optimizes query generation to improve the quality of retrieved paragraphs. These strategies are claimed to significantly enhance retrieval quality and efficiency.

#### Summary
The paper proposes a novel iterative retrieval framework (TOR) that uses a tree structure to minimize error accumulation and incorporates optimization strategies to improve retrieval efficiency and quality. Experiments show that TOR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets.
