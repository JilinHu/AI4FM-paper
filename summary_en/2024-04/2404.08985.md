#### Background
- **Background**
The paper states that Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in executing multiple tasks in multimedia applications, spanning content generation, interactive entertainment, and artistic creation. Traditional methods often face the issue of knowledge confusion in their monolithic dense models, whereas Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) emerged as a promising solution with its sparse architecture, providing effective task decoupling.

- **Existing Work**
Humans display superior multitask performance when provided with explicit cues, such as recipes in cooking or clear signage during emergencies. While human multitasking strategies such as instruction tuning, in-context learning, and Chain-of-Thought have been integrated into model inferring or fine-tuning processes, these methods have been mostly explored in models with dense architectures. Forcing multiple tasks' knowledge into the same dense model can lead to catastrophic forgetting, affecting all tasks' performance. Moreover, the application of traditional MoE in multitask learning still faces challenges, such as selecting the right expert combination for each task.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a new framework named Intuition-MoR1E**
  - **Challenge 1: Selecting the correct expert combination**
  Current MoE routers, typically consisting of a linear layer followed by softmax, struggle with nuanced task differentiation, resulting in less than optimal feature allocation across experts. The paper introduces a new paradigm, Intuition-MoR1E, that leverages the inherent semantic clustering of instances to mimic human brain multitasking, offering implicit guidance to the router for optimized feature allocation.

  - **Challenge 2: The overhead of employing multiple experts for multitask**
  Multitask MoE needs to scale up experts in correspondence with tasks' number, which leads to additional costs in training and storage. To tackle this, the paper proposes an ultra-lightweight Mixture-of-Rank-1-Experts (MoR1E) architecture augmented with Low-rank Adapter (LoRA) for efficient model finetuning. Mathematically, MoR1E has equivalent capabilities to its LoRA-based counterparts while providing greater flexibility and achieving higher accuracy with similar parameter settings in practice.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Extensive experiments over 14 public datasets were conducted to assess the performance of the proposed Intuition-MoE framework, which notably improves both effectiveness and efficiency, resulting in up to a 2.15% increase in overall accuracy. To address the challenges faced in implementation and deployment, which include selecting the right expert combination for each task and the increase in the number of experts due to multitask, the study incorporates "implicit intuition" into the MoE-based router. By utilizing the benefits of the embedding model in semantic understanding and applying a clustering algorithm to form centroids as prior knowledge, the relevance of embeddings between input instances and this prior knowledge is computed, effectively solving these challenges and making the model more effective in task allocation decisions.

#### Summary
The paper presents a new framework for multitask fine-tuning of Large Language Models named Intuition-MoR1E, which draws on principles of human cognitive neuroscience and uses Rank-1 Experts formulation to manage a spectrum of intuitions, significantly enhancing parameter efficiency and multitask fine-tuning effectiveness.
