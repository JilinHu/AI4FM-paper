#### Background
- **Background**
To address the issue of large language models (LLMs) often reflecting a Western-centric perspective due to the data they are trained on, the paper highlights the importance of developing language technologies that are conscious of diverse cultures. This is vital as cultural biases can lead to unintended consequences such as reinforcing stereotypes and deterring global adoption.
- **Existing Work**
Existing cultural knowledge databases have several limitations: they often rely on formal knowledge sources which can miss evolving cultural nuances in local communities, present cultural knowledge assertively which fails to capture individual variations within cultural groups, and their evaluation methods don't accurately reflect real-world deployment of LLMs.

#### Core Contributions
- **Created a scalable pipeline for constructing cultural knowledge bases from online communities**
    - **Challenge 1: Processing massive noisy data**
      To address the assertiveness and diversity issues in existing cultural resources, the research introduced a generalizable framework, collecting cultural knowledge from online communities to form a knowledge base with 12K cultural descriptors from TikTok and 11K from Reddit, known as CultureBank. This knowledge base includes diverse viewpoints on similar cultural practices, allowing for inclusive cultural understanding through calculated agreement levels.

    - **Challenge 2: Assessing language models' cultural awareness**
      For effectively evaluating the cultural awareness of LLMs, researchers provided scenarios grounded in real-world situations linked to each cultural descriptor, such as a travel consultation example. They then evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs' cultural awareness using CultureBank, finding areas for improvement. Moreover, training LLMs on CultureBank was shown to enhance their performance on downstream culture-related tasks.
#### Implementation and Deployment
CultureBank is an open-source knowledge base that collects a vast amount of online cultural narratives via a Framework and is used for training and fine-tuning LLMs. The evaluation results show that LLMs fine-tuned on CultureBank demonstrate improved performance in zero-shot settings on two cultural tasks. CultureBank encompasses rich cultural descriptors and scenarios that can be used to assess and direct improvements in language models' performance on cultural awareness.

#### Summary
The paper presented a pipeline for building cultural knowledge bases and created CultureBank, a knowledge base including cultural descriptors from TikTok and Reddit. The paper further assessed LLMs' cultural awareness using this repository and trained more culturally-conscious language models to promote the development of culturally-aware language technologies in the future.
