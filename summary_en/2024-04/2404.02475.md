#### Background
- **Background**
The paper depicts the urgent needs for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in the smartphone domain, particularly in simplifying and automating tasks via understanding and executing user-given textual instructions. It notes that current technology has limited mass adoption due to its complexity.

- **Existing Work**
Existing RPA systems, digital assistants, or models often depend on limited datasets and predefined commands, making them unsuitable for open-domain mobile tasks or dealing with unstructured text inputs from real-world usersâ€”restricting their applicability and problem-solving capabilities.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a multi-agent framework system named PromptRPA**
    - **Challenge 1: How to automate smartphone tasks effectively**
        Automating tasks on smartphones requires the model to understand and transform unstructured text prompts from users. The paper addresses this challenge by creating a system capable of interpreting text prompts and matching them to online tutorials, then extracting execution steps and mapping them to corresponding phone operations.

    - **Challenge 2: How to optimize the system to reduce user intervention and improve accuracy**
        Initial inaccuracies in content extraction and data generation errors existed in the system. To enhance accuracy, the paper employs a human-in-the-loop approach, involving users in selecting high-quality execution steps, and optimizing the system through accumulated knowledge and user feedback.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experiment results indicated that the PromptRPA system could enhance performance across its information collection, instruction generation, and operation mapping stages, achieving a high success rate throughout the entire process. For instance, in the information collection stage, the system improved Top-5 hit rates from 97.21% (Baidu) to 100% and the Top-1 hit rate to 90.83%, compared to manual searches. The average number of user interactions per new task was reduced, with the system operating more autonomously when encountering similar tasks.

#### Summary
The paper presents the PromptRPA system, an effective solution to overcome limitations of RPA applications on mobile devices. Leveraging a multi-agent framework and online tutorials, it can interpret diverse textual prompts, addressing a wide range of RPA tasks. Performance evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in success rates, affirming the viability of text-driven control in RPA and paving the way for future advancements focused on enhanced functionality and broader applicability.
