#### Background
- **Background**
The article discusses the unique challenges of managing modern IT systems, which require scalability, reliability, and efficiency in processing large data streams. Traditional methods, dependent on manual tasks and rule-based approaches, have become inefficient for the substantial data volumes and alerts generated by IT systems. Artificial Intelligence for Operating Systems (AIOps) has emerged as a solution that utilizes advanced analytics, such as machine learning and big data, to strengthen incident management. AIOps is capable of detecting and predicting incidents, identifying root causes, and automating healing actions to improve quality and reduce operational costs. Despite its potential, the AIOps domain is in its infancy, decentralized, and lacks standardized conventions. 
- **Existing Work**
Existing research and industrial contributions are made without a consistent framework, lacking uniformity in data management, target problems, implementation details, requirements, and capabilities. Thus, a structured incident management procedure and guidelines for constructing an AIOps framework are necessary.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Challenge 1: Lack of unified terminology and consistent research framework**
      The study defines the most relevant terms and key concepts that have been variably adopted in the existing research work within the field of incident management (e.g., hardware/software failure management, anomaly detection, bug triage, fault localization, etc.). It establishes a comprehensive taxonomy to categorize notable research contributions based on criteria such as incident management tasks, application areas, data sources, and technical approaches.
  - **Challenge 2: The absence of appropriate datasets**
      The paper provides publicly available datasets for various incident tasks and application areas. This contribution is significant because finding the most suitable datasets for a specific task is typically not straightforward. Furthermore, it enables the replication and comparison of techniques within the same research area.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The article does not detail specific implementation and deployment aspects. Instead, it offers a comprehensive framework of the knowledge base of AIOps, including technical and research aspects, and lists the methods and metrics for categorizing significant research contributions within the field, based on the terminology proposed by the authors. The work also highlights the requirements to be considered when building effective AIOps models, including interpretability, scalability, and robustness. Regarding evaluation results, the paper provides publicly available datasets for different tasks and application areas but does not mention any comparison with other related work.

#### Summary
This paper presents an extensive literature review of incident management in the AIOps domain, aiming to structure knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and lay the groundwork for future developments in the field. The study establishes unified AIOps terminology and taxonomy, reveals existing challenges, and provides public datasets, offering direction and a basis for future research.
