#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the field of information retrieval, especially the modeling of document-level representation. The goal is to enhance the performance of retrieval models by enriching the embedding representation of documents using large language models (LLMs).

- **Existing Work**
Existing retrieval models have limitations in representing user queries and target documents, particularly for Bi-encoder, Cross-encoder, and Late-interaction models. Moreover, there has been no unified framework to enhance document-level embeddings with LLMs, and past studies have not fully exploited the potential of language models in data augmentation.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Model-Agnostic Framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Enriching Contextual Information in Document Embeddings**
        To improve the quality and robustness of retrievers, the paper introduces an LLM-augmented retrieval framework to enrich the contextual information in the embedding of documents. By generating relevant queries and titles through a large language model and combining them with chunks split from the original document, the paper enhances the richness and expressiveness of the document representation.

    - **Challenge 2: Improving Key Components in the Retrieval Model Training Process**
        The paper also proposes improvements to key components in the retrieval model training process, such as negative sampling and loss function. These improvements contribute to enhancing the training effectiveness of the model.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The proposed LLM-augmented retrieval framework was validated across various retrieval models, including Bi-encoders and ColBERTv2, achieving state-of-the-art results on LoTTE and BEIR datasets. This indicates that the document-level embedding framework and improvements to the training process of retrieval models can significantly enhance the performance of retrieval models.

#### Summary
The paper successfully presents and validates an LLM-augmented retrieval framework with enhanced document-level embedding. By generating synthetic relevant queries and titles to add more contextual information to document embeddings and improving key steps in the training of retrieval models, the paper improves the performance and robustness of retrieval models.
