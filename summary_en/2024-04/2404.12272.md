#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper acknowledges that Large Language Models (LLMs) make mistakes, such as hallucination and ignoring instructions, necessitating human validation of their outputs. Validating the behavior of LLMs is a significant challenge, leading researchers and industry developers to create tools for systematic testing of outputs such as prompt engineering and auditing tools.

- **Existing Work**
Existing approaches rely on metricsâ€”functions to automatically score LLM outputs, usually asserting true or false values. Metrics increasingly include calls to "evaluator" LLMs that grade outputs on hard-to-quantify qualities, like conciseness. However, these evaluator LLMs, much like the LLMs they assess, cannot be trusted due to their unintuitive sensitivity to minor wording or structure changes, and many systems fail to offer a way to verify the quality of LLM-generated evaluations.

#### Core Contributions
  - **A mixed-initiative approach called EvalGen**
      - **Challenge 1: How to maintain efficiency while minimizing alignment issues in evaluation?**
        To address the contradiction between evaluation automation and efficiency, EvalGen allows users to generate evaluation criteria and implement assertions within an interface. While generating candidate implementations (Python functions or LLM grader prompts), it asks users to grade a subset of LLM outputs, and this feedback helps in selecting implementations that align more with user grades.

      - **Challenge 2: Addressing the phenomenon of criteria drift**
        The research identified a phenomenon called criteria drift: while users need criteria to grade outputs, the act of grading helps them define those criteria. Some criteria seem to depend on the specific LLM outputs observed, questioning methods that assume evaluation criteria are independent of the observation of model outputs.

#### Implementation and Deployment
EvalGen is integrated into the existing open-source interface ChainForge, designed for prompt engineering and auditing. The paper conducted a qualitative study that found overall support for EvalGen but highlighted the subjectivity and iterative process required for alignment. It also discussed the implications for the design of future LLM evaluation assistants.

#### Summary
This paper proposes EvalGen, a user interface for aligning LLM-assisted evaluations of LLM outputs with human preferences using a mixed-initiative approach. It addresses the trustworthiness of LLM-generated evaluation functions and explores the dynamic nature of how users define and use evaluation criteria in practical applications.
