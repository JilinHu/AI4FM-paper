#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper discusses issues in language model alignment, especially related to the Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) technique. In RLHF, to prevent models from overfitting to the Reward Model and producing out-of-domain texts, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trainable policy and the SFT policy is minimized. The Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method refines the RLHF optimization task, eliminating the Reward Model but retaining an implicit requirement for the policy to stay close to the SFT policy. The authors argue that this implicit limitation leads to suboptimal results.

- **Existing Work**
The instability of existing methods can be attributed to the use of fixed reference models for regularization during training, i.e., maximizing rewards without significantly deviating from the reference model. This approach seems artificial, and the DPO method does not yield optimal results due to its implicit limitations.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a new method called Trust Region DPO (TR-DPO)**
    - **Challenge 1: Implicit limitation of not updating the reference model**
        Existing models like DPO use a static reference model to regularize training, which may not lead to the best strategies. To address this challenge, the TR-DPO method updates the reference policy parameters interactively during training with soft and hard updates. Soft updates blend the current policy with the previous reference policy using a weighting factor α within [0, 1]. Hard updates replace the reference policy with the updated policy every τ training steps, leading to significant learning advancements.

    - **Challenge 2: How to adjust the training objective to improve strategies**
        Merely updating the reference policy parameters does not tell us how to alter the training objective. TR-DPO can be seen as a method between the original DPO objective and Trust region optimization since it allows for controlling the frequency of reference policy updates. By selecting different values of α (or τ), the method can transition smoothly from sparse to frequent updates, enabling the policy to potentially move further away from the original reference policy and enhancing model performance.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experiments evaluated the training configurations on two datasets: Anthropic-HH and Reddit TL;DR summarization. The authors experimented with a range of Pythia models from 410M to 12B parameters and explored two main update strategies: soft updates and hard updates. Through automated and combined human evaluations, TR-DPO outperformed DPO on both the Anthropic HH and TLDR datasets, with up to a 19% performance increase measured by automatic evaluation with GPT-4. The results indicate that the new alignment approach can improve the quality of models across several parameters, such as coherence, correctness, detail, helpfulness, and harmlessness.

#### Summary
The paper introduces a novel method known as Trust Region DPO (TR-DPO), which significantly improves the alignment issue in language models by interactively updating reference policy parameters. Experimental results show that TR-DPO surpasses the DPO method on both datasets, effectively enhancing the model's multi-parameter performance.
