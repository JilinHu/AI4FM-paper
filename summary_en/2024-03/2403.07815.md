#### Background
- **Background**
Traditional forecasting dominated by statistical models like ARIMA and ETS is transitioning towards deep learning models due to the availability of large and diverse time series data sources and operational forecasting problems well-suited for deep forecasters.

- **Existing Work**
Existing methods involve prompting pretrained large language models (LLMs) or fine-tuning LLMs for time series tasks. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on prompt engineering or fine-tuning for each new task and on large-scale models like GPT-3 which require extensive computational resources for training and inference.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a minimalist-adapted framework for time series forecasting, Chronos**
    - **Challenge 1: The fundamental difference between language and time series models**
      Chronos challenges the necessity for time-series-specific modifications by tokenizing time series into discrete bins using simple scaling and quantization, thus allowing off-the-shelf language models to learn the "language of time series" with no architecture changes. This addresses the standard mode of training and prediction within the same domain and showcases the potential to use language model architectures to deal with a broad range of time series problems with minimal adaptations.

    - **Challenge 2: The scarcity of public time series datasets**
      Beyond using a broad collection of public datasets for training Chronos, the framework incorporates data augmentation strategies like TSMix and KernelSynth to compensate for the limited training data typically available in time series forecasting, enhancing model robustness and generalization.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Chronos' comprehensive evaluation across 42 datasets establishes it as a benchmark for in-domain and zero-shot forecasting, outperforming both classical and deep learning models. Notably, it achieves impressive performance in zero-shot forecasting without specific task adjustments and is a favorable alternative to larger, more computationally intensive models for such applications.

#### Summary
Chronos has demonstrated exceptional performance as a pre-trained time series forecasting framework in both zero-shot and standard tasks. By leveraging data augmentation strategies and public datasets, it validates the promise of language model architectures for general applicability in time series forecasting, pointing towards a new direction for future time series models.
