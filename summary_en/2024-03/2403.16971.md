#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the challenges in integrating and deploying LLM-based intelligent agents, which affect their efficiency and efficacy. These challenges include sub-optimal scheduling and resource allocation of agent requests over the LLM, difficulties in maintaining context during interactions, and the complexities of integrating heterogeneous agents with varying capabilities.

- **Existing Work**
There is no system currently capable of effectively managing the functional allocation of LLM and OS, as well as providing solutions to challenges in scheduling and resource allocation, context management, memory management, tool service management, and access control. The existing work has not adequately addressed challenges arising from the increased number and complexity of agents.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced AIOS, an LLM Agent Operating System**
      - **Challenge 1: Resource Allocation and Scheduling Optimization**
          AIOS is designed to optimize LLM resource allocation and scheduling, addressing intelligent agent requests scheduling challenges, and improves LLM utilization with the "Agent Scheduler" module.

      - **Challenge 2: Context and Memory Management**
          The "Context Manager" in AIOS can snapshot and restore the intermediate generation status in LLM and manage the context window, while "Memory Manager" provides short-term memory for the interaction logs of agents.

#### Implementation and Deployment
AIOS provides several key modules to handle different aspects of LLM agent operations, including an agent scheduler, context manager, memory manager, storage manager, tool manager, and access manager. The reliability and efficiency of the AIOS modules were demonstrated through experiments with concurrent execution of multiple agents. The system also includes an LLM system call interface and an AIOS SDK, allowing agents to transparently use these services and making it more convenient for agent developers. The results show that AIOS is effective in supporting multi-agent concurrent execution of complex multimodal tasks that require reasoning, execution, and interaction with the physical world, and enhances performance and efficiency.

#### Summary
AIOS, as an LLM agent operating system, overcomes challenges in areas such as resource scheduling and context management through the design of a specific kernel and modules, providing improvements in performance and efficiency for LLM agents and paving the way for the future development and deployment of the AIOS ecosystem.
