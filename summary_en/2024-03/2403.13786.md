#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses how to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for understanding psychiatric behavior through the comprehension of dyadic contexts.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work lacks the ability to deeply understand professional psychological knowledge and the intricate interactions between patient and therapist, thus failing in predicting therapeutic outcomes effectively.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a 'Chain-of-Interaction' (CoI) prompting method**
  - **Challenge 1: Inadequate Efficacy**
      Traditional methods do not achieve deep enough understanding of professional psychological knowledge and dyadic interactions, leading to insufficient prediction of therapeutic efficacy. The introduced method addresses this by promoting the model's understanding of interactions and by simulating the thought processes of professionals.
  - **Challenge 2: Balancing Objective Coding and Subjective Rating**
      The challenge is to consider both the objective coding of patient behavior and the subjective rating within the therapeutic process. The CoI prompting method addresses this by assessing the level of patient engagement, capturing cues of emotional expression and self-exploration.
#### Implementation and Deployment
To validate the effectiveness of the 'Chain-of-Interaction' prompting method, a comparative analysis was conducted with state-of-the-art baselines along with a detailed ablation study. The experiments used four representative auto-regressive LLMs, including Llama2-13B-Chat, Falcon-7B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and ChatGPT. The results demonstrate that the CoI prompting method guides the models better in analyzing the positivity and negativity of patient behavioral expressions, improving models' precision and rationality on the task of motivational interview patient behavior coding compared to baseline methods.

#### Summary
The paper successfully improves the capability of Large Language Models in understanding psychiatric behaviors, especially in motivational interview contexts. By employing structured prompting and assessment methods to model professional therapists' thought processes, it effectively educates the model with domain knowledge, achieving better performance than conventional methods.
