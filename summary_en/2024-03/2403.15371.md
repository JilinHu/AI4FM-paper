#### Background
- **Background**
The paper delves into the aspect of exploration by Large Language Models (LLMs) for reinforcement learning and decision-making, focusing on the native performance of the models without any training interventions. LLMs are deployed in multi-armed bandit environments with the environment description and interaction history entirely provided by prompts. Experiments with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2 under various prompt designs reveal that without significant interventions, the models fail to robustly engage in exploration.

- **Existing Work**
Past research indicates that when LLMs are specially trained with data from reinforcement learning agents or expert demonstrations, they can display behavior including exploration. However, this training is often task-specific, costly, and labor-intensive. Moreover, these findings do not clarify whether exploratory behavior is naturally manifested in LLMs trained through standard methods, posing the fundamental question: Can contemporary LLMs naturally explore in-context?

#### Core Contributions
- **Exploring the performance of LLMs as agents in simple synthetic reinforcement learning problems**
    - **Challenge 1: Natural occurrence of exploration in LLMs**
        Challenge 1 involves determining if LLMs inherently have the capability to explore without training interventions. The study tackles this question using multi-armed bandit problems to test LLMs, which separates the exploration-exploitation trade-off. LLMs generally do not demonstrate robust exploratory behavior without appropriate prompt designs, but can do so when used with GPT-4 and prompts encouraging exploration, external summary of interaction history, and zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

    - **Challenge 2: Statistical subtlety and computational constraints**
        Challenge 2 is searching through a combinatorially large space of prompt designs to achieve statistically significant results while constrained by budget and computation. The paperâ€™s method is to identify surrogate statistics to diagnose long-term exploration failure, using few replicates and short learning cycles to characterize such failures even when reward measurements are too noisy.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experimental findings indicate that most LLM configurations do not engage in robust exploration, often failing to select the best action (arm) even after initial rounds. This is evident in various experimental settings, notably with GPT-4 under basic prompt design where more than 60% of trials did not converge to better options. The only successful configuration involved GPT-4 combined with an enhanced prompt, providing a hint to explore, externally summarizing the interaction history, and asking for zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning. Researchers suggest that although the current generation of LLMs might explore in simple RL settings with proper prompting, training interventions may be required for more complex decision-making capabilities.

#### Summary
This paper investigates whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) can engage in in-context exploration without any training interventions. The authors' experiments reveal that LLMs are capable of robust exploration only under specific configurations. This work indicates that even state-of-the-art LLMs might fail to explore in more complex environments without adequate prompt design, highlighting that non-trivial algorithmic interventions may be required for effective LLM operation in complicated settings.
