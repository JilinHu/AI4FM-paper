#### Background
- **Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened up new capabilities and applications; however, evaluating their alignment with human preferences remains a significant challenge.

- **Existing Work**
The research community has introduced various benchmarks to assess the performance of LLMs. However, prevalent evaluation methods, which are static and ground-truth-based, often fail to capture the nuanced and diverse aspects of these models, particularly in terms of aligning with human preferences in real-world open-ended tasks.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced Chatbot Arena, an open platform for evaluating LLMs**
      - **Challenge 1: Diversity of real-world scenario questions**
      Chatbot Arena overcomes this by using a crowdsourcing approach to collect diverse user questions that accurately represent real-world scenarios, providing a basis for useful discrimination between different models.
      - **Challenge 2: Efficient evaluation and ranking of numerous models**
      Chatbot Arena employs a range of robust statistical techniques to evaluate and rank models effectively, ensuring reliable results for a large number of models through an efficiently designed sampling algorithm.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The platform has been operational since April 2023, collecting over 240,000 votes from about 90,000 users in over 100 different languages. To foster user engagement, the authors have provided access to more than 50 state-of-the-art models for free and collaborated with leading model developers such as OpenAI and Google, integrating the latest models into the platform. They maintain community engagement by constantly updating the leaderboard, publishing analytical blogs, releasing datasets, and sharing information, making Chatbot Arena one of the most referenced benchmarks in the LLM field.

#### Summary
Chatbot Arena is an open platform for evaluating LLMs based on human preferences. It employs a crowdsourced approach to collect questions for anonymous randomized battles, addressing the limitations of static dataset benchmarks, and uses carefully designed statistical methods to ensure the credibility and efficiency of evaluations.
