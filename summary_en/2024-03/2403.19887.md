#### Background
- **Background**
Jamba is a new large language model introduced by the paper, based on a novel hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture. Jamba combines layers of Transformer and Mamba along with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) component, thus offering improved performance and higher throughput while maintaining a manageable memory footprint. The paper's 7B-base Jamba model is designed to fit on a single 80GB GPU and comes with a flexible architecture that allows for resource and objective-specific configurations.

- **Existing Work**
Despite the Transformer's popularity as the dominant architecture for large language models, it has two main drawbacks: its high resource consumption limits the processing of long contexts, and the absence of a single summary state leads to slow inference and low throughput. Recent state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba are more efficient than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in handling long distances relations but still fall short of the performance of similarly sized Transformer language models.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a new language model with hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture**
      - **Challenge 1: Handling Long Context**
        Jamba employs a mix of Transformer and Mamba layers, along with MoE components, to address the ability to handle long contexts. This structure allows balancing memory usage, efficient training, and long context capabilities by adjusting the ratio of Transformer to Mamba layers, which is crucial for different hardware and performance requirements.

      - **Challenge 2: Increasing Model Throughput While Maintaining a Small Memory Footprint**
        By applying MoE to some MLP layers, Jamba increases the model capacity without increasing computational demands (i.e., the number of active parameters remains manageable). This approach enables Jamba to train very large models with strong performance, and shows superior capabilities in long-context evaluations.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Jamba's model has shown comparable performance to Mixtral-8x7B on a wide range of benchmarks and standard language model tests, and even outperforms the larger Llama-2 70B model. Notably, Jamba supports context lengths of up to 256K tokensâ€”the longest among commercially available production-grade models. In long-context evaluations, Jamba consistently outperforms Mixtral on most datasets. Moreover, Jamba is exceptionally efficient; for instance, it has triple the throughput of Mixtral-8x7B for long contexts. Additionally, Jamba can fit on a single GPU (using 8bit weights) even with contexts exceeding 128K tokens, which isn't possible with similarly sized attention-only models like Mixtral-8x7B.

#### Summary
Jamba represents a new direction in the large language model domain with its hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture that breaks through the limitations of handling long contexts and optimizes both model throughput and memory footprint by applying MoE components. This model demonstrates the potential balance between efficient training and powerful performance in the field of large-scale language modeling.
