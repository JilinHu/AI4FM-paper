#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses the issue of aligning and personalizing Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on their adaptation to different human preferences, learning new skills, and unlearning harmful behavior. Traditional search-based methods like Best-of-N or Monte-Carlo Tree Search, though effective, are impractical due to their high inference costs; on the other hand, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is computationally more efficient but performs poorly because of optimization challenges in co-training the value function and policy.

- **Existing Work**
Existing RL methods, while computationally efficient for deployment, are outperformed by simple Best-of-N search due to their need to access model weights and inability to perform real-time composition or fine-grained adaptation. Additionally, performance is often constrained by the challenges of training a value estimator for a non-stationary policy, resulting in noisy policy updates and potentially converging only to suboptimal solutions.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduces a framework named Value Augmented Sampling (VAS)**
    - **Challenge 1: How to optimize rewards without co-training policy and value function**
        Value Augmented Sampling avoids the bi-level optimization process, a known cause of sub-optimality in actor-critic RL methods, by estimating the value function of the reward function using data collected from the base LLM policy.

    - **Challenge 2: How to adapt to new and multiple user preferences without changing model weights**
        By keeping the base LLM weights unchanged, VAS can adapt to new and multiple user preferences during deployment without needing any re-training of the LLM, and also to closed-source LLMs where weights are inaccessible.
    
#### Implementation and Deployment
VAS outperforms established baselines such as PPO and DPO in standard benchmark tests, performing comparably with Best-of-128 in summarization and multi-turn chat dialogue tasks while being at least six times more computationally efficient. Moreover, VAS provides fine-grained control over adaptation intensity at inference, usable for personalizing outputs according to user preferences.

#### Summary
Value Augmented Sampling (VAS) offers an efficient and powerful solution for adapting and personalizing LLMs. It overcomes the instabilities of existing RL algorithms, achieving both high performance and computational efficiency, supports adaptation of black-box models, and paves the way for the personalized and aligned future of LLMs.
