#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the application of augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies in enhancing document reading experiences. Existing systems usually require pre-processed documents and pre-generated content, limiting their generalizability and real-world use cases.
- **Existing Work**
Prior systems lack the capability of on-demand and real-time content generation for non-prepared documents, constraining their widespread practicality and utility in real-world applications.

#### Core Contributions
  - **RealitySummary system**
    - **Challenge 1: Augmenting document reading experiences**
      Existing systems need pre-processing of documents and beforehand content creation, restricting their practicality in real applications. RealitySummary leverages large language models to offer instant content extraction and document augmentation that works with any print or digital document without prior preparation, addressing the limitations.
    
    - **Challenge 2: Designing and implementing MR document enhancement techniques**
      Identified five categories of document enhancement techniques—summarization, augmentation, navigation, comparison, and extraction. Selected six specific techniques—summaries, comparison tables, timelines, keyword lists, summary highlighting, and information cards—to be incorporated into the RealitySummary system. The system automatically extracts and summarizes text using Google Cloud OCR and GPT-4, then embeds the information using Microsoft Hololens 2 and Apple Vision Pro around the documents.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The RealitySummary system was developed with a set of design features and summarization techniques determined through a design workshop to enhance the mixed reality document experience. It uses Google Cloud OCR and GPT-4 to automatically extract and summarize text, showcasing six specific types of document augmentations in real-time. Two user studies were conducted, a usability study with twelve participants and an in-the-wild study with eleven participants, underscoring the potential benefits of on-demand MR document enhancements.

#### Summary
This paper introduces the RealitySummary system, combining large language models with mixed reality technology to provide an on-demand reading assistant and highlights the potential for practical application of this technology and establishes directions for future research.
