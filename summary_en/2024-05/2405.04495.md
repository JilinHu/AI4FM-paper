#### Background
- **Background**       
This paper explores the potential of large language models as pedagogical tools, particularly in adaptive teaching contexts, focusing on how teachers can provide informative examples based on students' current state of knowledge to help them progress towards a target concept or skill.

- **Existing Work**   
Although large language models have shown the ability to adapt to new tasks with minimal examples, their effectiveness as teachers in adapting to various types of students is not yet clear. Existing teaching models often fail to effectively adapt to and address students' specific misconceptions and presuppositions.

#### Core Contributions
- **Proposed a probabilistic model named ATOM**
    - **Challenge 1: Online inference of students' misconceptions and presuppositions**
        Understanding the current beliefs and misconceptions of students is crucial for providing effective teaching, but it is often difficult to obtain and process this information in real-time. The ATOM model effectively addresses this challenge by dynamically inferring students' prior beliefs and optimizing for the correctness of future beliefs.

    - **Challenge 2: Selection of the most effective teaching examples**
        Choosing the most misconceptions-correcting example from many possible teaching methods is a complex decision-making problem. ATOM not only infers existing misconceptions of students but also selects the most informative teaching examples based on these inferences, thus enhancing teaching efficiency.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Comparative tests of the ATOM model with traditional LLMs and Bayesian teaching models on simulated students show that ATOM systematically performs better across three learning domains: fraction arithmetic, English morphology, and function learning. In human experiments, ATOM and LLMs outperform non-adaptive random example selection, demonstrating higher teaching efficiency. These results emphasize the difficulty of the adaptive teaching task and the potential of learned adaptive models to address this challenge.

#### Summary
This paper successfully demonstrates the potential of using large language models for adaptive teaching and achieves effective identification of student misconceptions and optimization of teaching feedback through the ATOM model.
