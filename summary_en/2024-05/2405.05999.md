#### Background
- **Background**
  The paper discusses the widespread use of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in critical infrastructures and how these systems are becoming vulnerable to cyber threats due to their increased connectivity and advanced features, which could lead to significant disruptions in essential services.

- **Existing Work**
  Current ICS honeypot frameworks are primarily focused on emulating industrial protocols, requiring extensive knowledge and implementation capabilities of network communication protocols. These frameworks face challenges including the proprietary nature of protocols and the level of expert knowledge and manual labor intensity needed for implementation.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Proposal of an LLM-based honeypot design approach**
    - **Challenge 1: Accurate Emulation**
      Existing systems struggle with precise emulation of industrial environments and require significant manual operations and expert knowledge. LLMPot addresses this by automating and optimizing the creation of honeypots through the use of pre-trained LLMs, thereby reducing manual labor and expert knowledge requirements and more effectively mimicking unique operational behaviors of various industrial protocols and control logic.

    - **Challenge 2: Adaptability**
      Traditional honeypots often lack flexibility in adapting to different operational scenarios. LLMPot enhances adaptability by using Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of generating network interactions closely aligned with actual industrial control protocols and physical processes, thus improving the interactivity and indistinguishability of the honeypots.

#### Implementation and Deployment
LLMPot conducted extensive experiments simulating different industrial protocols and control logic, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LLM-based approach. This method manages to create honeypots with high perceptual quality and interactivity, effectively preventing cyber-attacks.

#### Summary
LLMPot represents a novel ICS network defense tool that leverages the capabilities of LLMs. By automating the generation of responses closely related to protocols and physical processes, LLMPot significantly enhances the practicality and effectiveness of honeypots.
