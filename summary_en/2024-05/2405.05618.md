#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the importance of efficiently processing tabular data, especially when managing datasets with numerous columns. Despite the capabilities of LLMs being proven through meticulously crafted prompts, generating effective prompts for tabular datasets remains challenging due to the structured nature of the data and the need to manage multiple columns.
- **Existing Work**
Current studies have demonstrated manual methods of creating prompts for specific datasets and tasks by selecting columns and relevant few-shot examples. However, this manual process is exceedingly difficult when dealing with large datasets containing many columns.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced an automatic prompt generation system**
    - **Challenge 1: Optimal selection and ordering of columns**
      Identifying and sequencing task-relevant columns efficiently is crucial for improving performance in tabular data tasks. The paper uses a Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm to address the inefficiency and difficulty of manually selecting columns.
    - **Challenge 2: Improving the few-shot example selection method based on cell-level similarity**
      Traditional few-shot example selection methods for natural language tasks may lose relevant information during serialization. The proposed method considers each cell's information independently, which is more suitable for tabular data tasks.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Extensive testing over 66 datasets showed improved performance in three downstream tasks: data imputation, error detection, and entity matching, using two different LLMs, Google flan-t5-xxl and Mixtral 8x7B. This demonstrates that the system effectively enhances the precision and efficiency of tasks compared to traditional methods.

#### Summary
The paper successfully develops an auto-prompt generation system compatible with various LLMs without extensive training, significantly enhancing the performance of tabular data tasks through two innovative methods.
