#### Background
- **Background**
This paper discusses the challenges of automating modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs), highlighting the limitations of traditional rule-based Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems in adapting to GUI changes. Particularly, these systems struggle to handle the diversity of application layouts and screen resolutions efficiently.

- **Existing Work**
Current RPA systems are largely dependent on pre-defined pixel-encoded rules and workflows, which results in fragility when facing GUI changes or tasks of higher complexity. They lack flexibility and find it hard to adapt to different application layouts, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic interfaces and variable tasks.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced an AI-based RPA system named SmartFlow**
      - **Challenge 1: Handling diverse application layouts and screen resolutions.**
      SmartFlow uses vision technologies and natural language processing to autonomously generate navigation workflows adaptively to GUI changes with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, successfully overcoming the challenges faced by traditional RPA systems.

  - **Challenge 2: Adaptability to GUI changes and handling complex tasks.**
      Beyond generating navigation workflows, SmartFlow is also designed with robust adaptability to handle multi-page form submission applications with various field types, such as date pickers, dropdown menus, etc., effectively.

#### Implementation and Deployment
SmartFlow processes task requests through a series of steps. Initially, it preprocesses to cleanse the HTML source code, ensuring it fits the size limit of LLMs. Then, it uses LLMs to extract names and types of form elements, with visual algorithms like EasyOCR capturing text regions from screenshot images. This information is merged with the layout mapping, creating a Mapping List via LLM to generate the navigation workflow. In the navigation workflow generation step, LLM and the mapping list and task request are used to automatically generate the code needed to execute the workflow (like PyAutoGUI scripts), completing the task request precisely by clicking on the correct form field. SmartFlow efficiently handles different field types like datepickers, dropdown menus, etc., demonstrating high precision and practicality in executing these tasks.

#### Summary
SmartFlow is an AI-based RPA system that integrates deep learning vision understanding with LLMs to autonomously generate navigation workflows and execute user-assigned tasks, demonstrating efficiency in adapting to GUI changes and handling complex tasks.
