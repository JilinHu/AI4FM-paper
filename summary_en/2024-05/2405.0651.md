#### Background
- **Background**
    The article discusses the longstanding issue of data manipulation in data lakes, where traditional methods based on rules or machine learning require extensive human efforts in data collection and model tuning.

- **Existing Work**
    Existing methods, despite utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for various data manipulation tasks, still require customized designs for each specific task, which is costly and cannot meet the demands of large data lake platforms.

#### Core Contributions
- **Proposed a unified framework UniDM**
  - **Challenge 1: How to design a framework that elegantly unifies different data manipulation tasks?**
      The challenge lies in designing a framework that is general enough to encompass both common and new tasks. UniDM addresses this by formalizing data manipulation tasks, providing a framework that can be easily extended to new tasks.
   
  - **Challenge 2: How to design a general solution under this unified framework?**
      This challenge focuses on finding the right prompts to lead LLMs in generating high-quality outcomes. UniDM simplifies the task by breaking down the data manipulation into several consistent steps, making it more manageable for LLMs.

#### Implementation and Deployment
UniDM has been thoroughly evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating its generality and state-of-the-art performance on multiple data manipulation tasks. The framework optimizes the data processing workflow through steps like automatic extraction of relevant context, transformation of this context, and construction of targeted prompts.

#### Summary
UniDM is an innovative unified framework for data manipulation that significantly enhances the efficiency and quality of processing diverse data tasks through effective prompt design and task decomposition.
