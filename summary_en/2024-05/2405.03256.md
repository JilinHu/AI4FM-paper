#### Background
- **Background**
The paper identifies Requirements Engineering (RE) as a crucial phase in the software development process, focusing on generating requirement specifications from stakeholders' needs. Developers invest substantial effort in various RE tasks to create high-quality requirement models and write requirement specifications due to the increasing complexity and scale of software systems.

- **Existing Work**
While deep learning (DL) technologies have been successfully used to automate numerous RE tasks, including mining stakeholders' needs, extracting requirements models, and addressing ambiguities in requirements, achieving high-quality specifications requires interwoven and iterative tasks. The automation of only a limited set of these tasks has constrained further gains in effectiveness and efficiency.

#### Core Contributions
- **A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework (MARE)**
  - **Challenge 1: Achieving end-to-end automation of the RE process**
      MARE represents the first research effort known to fully automate the entire RE process end-to-end. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to unify main tasks without requiring specialized models for each task, thereby simplifying the process.

  - **Challenge 2: Iteratively handling basic RE tasks**
      Through merely specifying a rough idea concerning the requirements, MARE can iteratively handle the elicitation, modeling, verification, and specification tasks. This approach enables MARE to autonomously complete the essential tasks of the RE process, resulting in the generation of requirement specifications.

#### Implementation and Deployment
In the evaluation of MARE, researchers conducted experiments on nine case studies and one dataset, comparing it with three state-of-the-art baselines. MARE excelled in the modeling aspect, outperforming the baselines by up to 15.4% in F1 score on widely used evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1. For the capability to generate requirement specifications, a human evaluation was conducted to assess quality in three aspects (correctness, completeness, and consistency), providing insights into their quality.

#### Summary
This research presents a novel Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework, MARE, for leveraging collaboration between Large Language Models (LLMs) throughout the entire Requirements Engineering process. It addresses limitations in the automation of RE tasks and demonstrates superiority in requirement modeling and specification generation, as verified by extensive experimental evaluation.
