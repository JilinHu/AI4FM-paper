#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses how LLMs have captured public attention and are set to impact various sectors. However, randomness in language model definitions has led to variable success in adapting LLMs to specific problems. Despite interest in prompt engineering, the process of choosing and refining prompts has been largely trial-and-error.
  
- **Existing Work**
Existing work has focused on searching the space of prompts without considering the relations between prompt variations. Iterative methods for improving prompts based on substitutions, additions, or deletions have left a gap in effectively combining elements from a prompt library for optimization.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introducing a framework: Prompt Exploration with Prompt Regression (PEPR)**
    - **Challenge 1: Predicting the impact of prompt element combinations on LLM outputs**
      PEPR derives parameter weights for prompt elements by building a prompt library and utilizes these weights to select elements that correspond to the desired output. This allows for effective prediction and selection of prompts for specific use cases.
      
    - **Challenge 2: Tackling the exponential growth of the solution space**
      By simplifying the process into prompt regression to determine the influence of elements, followed by prompt selection and prompt recovery, PEPR addresses the impracticality of brute-force approaches due to exponential growth in the number of prompt elements.
  
#### Implementation and Deployment
The PEPR framework is used to predict the effects of prompt combinations and to select effective prompts for given use cases. To validate both components of PEPR, evaluations were performed on open-source LLMs of varying sizes across several datasets and tasks. While specific evaluation results are not provided in the abstract copy, conceptually, this method involves combining the influence of prompt library elements with reference texts or preference information to predict their impact on LLM outputs.

#### Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework, PEPR, for predicting the impact of prompt element combinations in LLMs and selecting effective prompts for specific tasks. The framework not only brings an innovative solution but also demonstrates its effectiveness through evaluations on multiple datasets and tasks.
