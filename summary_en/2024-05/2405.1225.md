#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the revolutionary impact of transformer architectures in natural language processing, although the complexity of these models remains an active area of research. The study points out that previous research seldom focused on the inherent linearity of embedding transformations within these architectures.

- **Existing Work**
Existing work has not fully explored the linearity dynamics of transformer decoders and its implications during the pretraining and fine-tuning stages.

#### Core Contributions
- **Extensive analysis of the linearity properties of transformer decoders**
    - **Challenge 1: Unveiling the inherent linearity of transformer architectures**
        The paper discovers a surprising finding: the embedding transformations between sequential layers in transformer decoders exhibit almost perfect linearity properties (Procrustes similarity score of 0.99). This finding not only challenges the traditional understanding of transformer architectures but also opens new opportunities for model optimization and efficiency.

    - **Challenge 2: Removing the most linear layers or linearly approximating decoders without significant loss in performance**
        The paper develops new algorithms for depth pruning of transformer decoders, allowing the removal of the most linear layers without significantly sacrificing performance.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper also introduces a novel distillation technique that involves pruning, replacing certain layers with linear approximations, and then distilling layer-wise embeddings to preserve model performance. In addition, they introduce a new regularization approach for pretraining based on cosine similarity, aimed at decreasing the layer linearity. This method not only improves the performance of transformer models on benchmark datasets such as SuperGLUE but also enhances the expressiveness of embeddings and successfully reduces model linearity.

#### Summary
This study showcases that there might be a high degree of linear dynamics between the encoding layers of transformers, overturning the traditional understanding of linear and non-linear operations in transformers, and finding that models can be modified for efficiency without sacrificing performance.
