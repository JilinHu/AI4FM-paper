#### Background
- **Background**
    The paper recognizes that Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed Natural Language Processing due to their proficiency in general language understanding and generation. Instruction finetuning has been introduced to improve the alignment of language models with humans in various tasks.

- **Existing Work**
    Despite significant developments in collecting extensive instruction finetuning data to better align LLMs to provide useful responses, diversity and quality pose as two main challenges for instruction finetuning. Current methods often depend on another model to judge quality or diversity, ignoring the inherent behaviors and capabilities of LLMs themselves.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced G-DIG, a Gradient-based method**
    - **Challenge 1: How to select high-quality training examples with beneficial effects on the model**
        The authors posit that high-quality data should positively influence high-quality test samples. Thus, they manually create a small set of high-quality seed data and then automatically select high-quality data that have positive influences on this seed data.

    - **Challenge 2: How to increase the diversity of training data**
       To improve the diversity of training data, they cluster on the gradients that represent their influences on the model and resample to maximize the variety of impacts on the model.

#### Implementation and Deployment
After thorough comparisons ranging from 1k to 64k selected samples, the proposed method surpasses baseline selective methods and achieves competitive performance compared to SOTA models. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses highlighting the necessity of data selection have demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed methods through tests on WMT22 and FLORES translation tasks.

#### Summary
The paper presents the G-DIG method, a gradient-based approach for selecting high-quality and diverse instruction finetuning data for machine translation, validated by its effectiveness and generalizability through experimental verification.
