#### Background
- **Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs) perpetuate societal biases that stem from unvetted data sources or unbalanced representations of various social groups, affecting decision-making processes, reinforcing stereotypes, and exacerbating existing inequalities.

- **Existing Work**
Conventional debiasing techniques generally require access to the model's internals, re-training, data augmentation, or modifications in the modelâ€™s decoding strategies. However, for state-of-the-art LLMs, which often don't provide access to internals or training data for privacy and commercial reasons, such methods are not feasible, as they could potentially affect the performance on other downstream tasks.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Developed an end-user iterative debiasing framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Bias Mitigation in Text Generation**
      Traditional debiasing methods have fallen short in ensuring fair text generation due to their dependencies on retraining, access to the model's internals, or modifications in decoding strategies. This study investigated "System 2 thinking" based prompting as a means to foster logical, reflective, and critical text generation. By evaluating various LLMs with multiple prompting strategies, the study found that the more complex System 2-based Implicative Prompts significantly reduced bias in outputs while maintaining competitive performance on downstream tasks.
    - **Challenge 2: Bias Reduction Without Model Introspection**
      Though many sophisticated prompting strategies exist for diverse tasks, they are not specifically aimed at fair text generation. This research introduces new prompting methods (including Prefix Prompting, Self-Refinement, and Implication Prompting) and evaluates them on a variety of LLMs against several benchmarks. The results demonstrate debiasing capacities commensurate with existing methods while preserving performance on downstream tasks.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The framework systematically evaluated multiple LLMs across various data sets and prompting strategies. For instance, the prompting involved not just instructions but also role-playing, self-refinement, and suggestive prompts that improved task adaptation and reduced bias in output. The findings suggest that structured prompting can effectively reduce biases in textual outputs and remain competitive in downstream task performance.

#### Summary
The research developed and evaluated an iterative debiasing framework aimed at end-users, offering a non-training-based approach to mitigating biases in LLMs. This method employs complex prompting strategies that significantly decrease the mean bias in outputs without compromising downstream task performance, paving the way for future research into prompt-based debiasing methods for LLMs.
