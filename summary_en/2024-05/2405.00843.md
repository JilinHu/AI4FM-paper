#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses the widespread issue of unwarranted beliefs, including pseudoscience, logical fallacies, and conspiracy theories, which pose significant societal hurdles and the risk of spreading misinformation. It has been found that a high proportion of individuals still hold these unwarranted beliefs.

- **Existing Work**
Despite progress in human critical thinking, existing research has only proposed various models and hypotheses about the origins of these unwarranted beliefs without resolving the issue. Previous studies have also not explored the unwarranted beliefs held by Large Language Models (LLMs) and the correlation between these beliefs and logical fallacies.

#### Core Contributions
- **Proposing a comparison between humans and LLMs in their ability to recognize logical pitfalls**
    - **Challenge 1: Identifying and combating unwarranted beliefs**
        One challenge is understanding and combating unwarranted beliefs. The article uses PEUBI (Popular Epistemically Unwarranted Beliefs Inventory), a psychometric tool, to assess and compare with the average human belief level, evaluating LLMs' performance on psychological tests containing natural language questions to assess their capability in combating unwarranted beliefs.

    - **Challenge 2: Developing persuasive cognitive models**
        They explore how to use LLMs as personalized misinformation debunking agents, challenging human unwarranted beliefs based on psychological models of persuasion such as cognitive dissonance theory and elaboration likelihood theory.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The researchers conducted a preliminary evaluation of LLMs' capabilities, which included the use of psychometric tests, and compared the results with corresponding human belief levels. Based on psychometry theory and techniques, they utilized the tool PEUBI to measure performance of LLMs on various unwarranted beliefs. Even though specific experimental results and data are not shown, researchers compared human and LLM cognitive models of belief and presented various methods for using LLMs as persuasive agents to challenge human unwarranted beliefs.

#### Summary
This paper explores how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and combat unwarranted beliefs, as well as to leverage LLMs as personalized misinformation debunking agents. The researchers propose new methods to assess and utilize LLMs' capabilities in identifying logical pitfalls and challenge human unwarranted beliefs.
