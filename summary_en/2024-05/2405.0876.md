#### Background
- **Background**
Humans often use indirect or non-literal language, requiring interpreters to grasp beyond mere words. Most existing studies focus on discriminative evaluations, with insufficient attention to generative response evaluations.

- **Existing Work**
Existing approaches through contrastive multiple-choice methods may effectively detect intentions but fail to reflect LLMs' abilities in generating appropriate responses aligned with communicative intents.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced a new generative evaluation framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Understanding and properly responding to non-literal language**
        Existing methods often fail to handle the implications of non-literal expressions accurately. This study introduces a framework to demonstrate the models' capability in understanding and generating responses that align with actual intent, especially in non-direct expressions.
    
    - **Challenge 2: Enhancing intent utilization in language models**
        Even with explicitly provided intentions, LLMs often struggle to use these to generate appropriate responses. The study employs a chain of thought method to prompt models to explicitly articulate their intentions before generating responses, aiming to enhance performance.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The study evaluated several contemporary open-source LLMs on their performance in dealing with various non-literal languages, finding that these models frequently failed to generate contextually appropriate responses, with afforded accuracy around 50-55% on average. The use of chain-of-thought showed promising but limited improvements. This highlights the need for better mechanisms in capturing and utilizing communicative intents effectively in practice.

#### Summary
This study introduces a novel generative evaluation framework exploring the potential and challenges of LLMs in understanding and generating intent-aligned responses, revealing significant shortcomings in pragmatic understanding and pointing out directions for future improvements.
