#### Background
- **Background**
The article describes how large language models (LLMs) continue to grow, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is gaining significant attention due to its exceptional performance. Unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling RLHF to train LLMs poses challenges coordinating across four models, especially as models expand beyond 70 billion parameters.

- **Existing Work**
Existing open-source RLHF frameworks such as Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL), ColossalChat (CAIChat), and DeepSpeed-Chat (DSChat) rely on parallelization like Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) to colocate the four models involved in RLHF training on the same GPU. However, the efficiency of this approach is decreasing for models over 70 billion parameters due to limited GPU memory.

#### Core Contributions
- **OpenRLHF: An Easy-to-use, Scalable, High-performance RLHF Framework**
    - **Challenge 1: Optimizing Scheduling and Resource Utilization**
        OpenRLHF innovates on model scheduling, using Ray for model placement and fine-grained orchestration, improving upon existing scheduling strategies for models beyond 70B parameters. Compared to existing frameworks, OpenRLHF improves resource utilization and supports diverse training approaches, offering seamless integration with Hugging Face for user-friendliness.

    - **Challenge 2: Enhancing Training and Inference Efficiency**
        To address the performance bottleneck of current training frameworks, OpenRLHF optimizes for larger LLMs such as 70B models that can't be deployed on a single GPU, using vLLMâ€™s tensor parallelism and advanced techniques for accelerating sample generation.

#### Implementation and Deployment
In terms of performance optimization, OpenRLHF displays significant advantages over the optimized DSChat. For instance, the total time consumption for training 1024 prompts with 1 PPO epoch is about 1.82 times faster for the 7B model compared to DSChat. Additionally, OpenRLHF provides one-click trainable scripts that are fully compatible with the Hugging Face library, simplifying the specification of models and datasets.

#### Summary
OpenRLHF is an open-source framework that enables full-scale RLHF training on models with over 70 billion parameters. It employs distributed computing with Ray and efficiency optimization with vLLM, while also implementing multiple alignment algorithms, offering a plug-and-play experience with seamless integration with the Hugging Face library.
