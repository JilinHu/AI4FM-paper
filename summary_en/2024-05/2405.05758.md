#### Background
- **Background**
This paper explores the potential of human-LLM synergy in qualitative analysis, particularly in the study of mental illness stigma. It highlights the crucial role of qualitative analysis in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and that, while LLMs can perform established qualitative coding, their potential for collaborative discovery and insight generation remains underexplored.

- **Existing Work**
Existing studies mainly quantify the agreement between LLM and human coders, focusing on model performance rather than exploring the reasons behind suboptimal outcomes, i.e., cases where the model's output deviates from the human-generated codes. This emphasis on quantitative measures overshadows the importance of qualitative discrepancy analysis, leading to a gap in understanding and interpreting instances where LLMs differ from human judgments.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Proposed a methodology framework called CHALET (Collaborative Human-LLM AnaLysis for Empowering Conceptualization in Qualitative Research)**
    - **Challenge 1: How to utilize human-LLM collaboration for discovering and generating new insights**
      Existing methods focus on quantitative analysis and code consistency, while CHALET engages in analyzing coding discrepancies through human-LLM cooperation to drive deeper qualitative analysis. This enables the discovery of new themes and perspectives, enriching the theoretical insights of qualitative research.

    - **Challenge 2: How to effectively manage and utilize large volumes of multidimensional data**
      The CHALET framework underscores the critical role of LLMs in all stages, not only assisting in multidimensional data collection but also promoting efficient data processing and extensive knowledge retrieval through LLM-assisted qualitative coding, crucial in handling large datasets.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The CHALET framework was validated through its application to the attribution model of mental illness stigma, revealing implicit stigmatization themes across cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. By analyzing inconsistencies between human coders and LLMs and conducting in-depth inductive coding with LLM support, we were able to uncover new themes and insights. This process demonstrates the practical significance of the CHALET framework in understanding and advancing research on mental health-related themes.

#### Summary
The CHALET methodology framework illustrates the vast potential of human-LLM collaboration in qualitative research, especially in deepening understanding and generating insights, offering a new direction for future studies in HCI and qualitative analysis.
