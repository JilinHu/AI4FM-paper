#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the surge in models and data within the AI/ML field due to rapid technological advancements, highlighting the need for standardized documentation. It specifically addresses the inadequacies in current human-generated model and data cards.

- **Existing Work**
Existing solutions heavily rely on developers' understanding and interpretations, leading to inconsistencies and omissions of critical information. Furthermore, the use of existing tools and templated approaches lacks enforcement of standards, compromising the comprehensiveness and reliability of the cards.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced an automated approach for generating model and data cards**
    - **Challenge 1: Enhancing consistency and completeness of documentation**
      Existing manually dependent methods might lead to incomplete and inconsistent information. The paper introduces the CARDGEN pipeline utilizing large LLMs like GPT3.5 to standardize and enhance the documentation process, increasing the consistency, completeness, and objectivity of generated content.

    - **Challenge 2: Assessing and validating the quality of generated content**
      Ensuring the automatically generated content is not only complete but also highly objective and understandable is essential. The introduction of new quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics, and comparisons with manually generated content, demonstrates the effectiveness of the CARDGEN pipeline.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The CARDGEN pipeline, which includes a two-step retrieval process and utilizes GPT3.5, outperforms manual methods in various assessment metrics such as completeness, objectivity, and understandability. By creating the CARDBENCH dataset, encompassing nearly 4800 model cards and 1400 data cards, it provides ample reference materials and benchmarks for the generation tasks.

#### Summary
The paper effectively develops a method to automate the generation of ML model cards and data cards using large LLMs, significantly enhancing the quality and standardization of the documentation through the creation of a corresponding dataset and evaluation mechanisms.
