#### Background
- **Background**
This article explores effective prompting strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform text-to-SQL tasks across different scenarios (zero-shot, single-domain, and cross-domain). Current research lacks comparability between prompt constructions and their primary contributions, and selecting an effective prompt construction has emerged as a persistent problem for future research.

- **Existing Work**
Previous studies have enhanced the text-to-SQL capability of LLMs using various strategies such as example retrieval strategies and intermediate reasoning steps. However, these studies often employ different prompting strategies that include various key components of text-to-SQL: database schema and content, and demonstration examples. This difference in prompt constructions makes it difficult to directly compare two studies on their main contributions, and the outcomes of different studies may change based on future discoveries in prompt engineering.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a comprehensive evaluation**
    - **Challenge 1: How to Construct Database Prompts**
        In the zero-shot setting, this study compares different constructions of database prompts and analyzes the impact of various constructions on model performance. Experiments show that there is a "sweet spot" in prompt length for the Codex model in the cross-domain setting.

    - **Challenge 2: Impact of Demonstration Prompt**
        This study analyzes the impact of the number of databases and the number of examples per database in demonstration prompts. Evidence suggests that suitable demonstration prompts can enhance the performance of language models in cross-database text-to-SQL tasks.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Based on the experimental results, various strategies for database prompt construction were evaluated in three commonly used text-to-SQL settings: zero-shot, single-domain, and cross-domain, considering various database prompt constructions in all three settings. Additionally, the study investigated strategies for constructing demonstrations in the cross-domain scenario. The evaluation aimed to gain insights into the effectiveness of these prompt construction strategies.

#### Summary
The study revealed the critical database knowledge and optimal representations for effective prompting, offering guidance for the application of LLMs in the text-to-SQL task, and pointed out a "sweet spot" in terms of prompt length in the cross-domain setting. The findings may not always be applicable to a specific database, particularly if the database is significantly different from the Spider databases.
