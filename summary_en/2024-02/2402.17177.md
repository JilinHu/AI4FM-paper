#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses Sora, a large vision model (LVM) released by OpenAI, capable of generating minute-long high-quality videos from text prompts. It underlines the model's ability to understand and execute complex human instructions, producing detailed scenes with characters and actions, and highlights the technological backbone which is a pretrained diffusion transformer equipped with spacetime latent patches.
- **Existing Work**
Existing video generation tools are generally limited to creating short video clips of a few seconds. By contrast, Sora signifies a major breakthrough by generating longer videos while maintaining quality and visual coherence, introducing new methods in model training that depart from the traditional practice of adjusting videos to a uniform standard.

#### Core Contributions
- **A comprehensive review of Sora is provided**
  - **Challenge 1: Complex video generation**
    Traditional trends focus on generating short video snippets, but creating longer videos requires managing more complex temporal consistency and visual quality. Sora overcomes these challenges with advanced deep learning frameworks and techniques like spacetime compression and diffusion transformers to produce high-quality videos up to a minute long.

  - **Challenge 2: Handling diverse video formats**
    Traditional models require adjusting videos to specific formats and aspect ratios, whereas Sora can handle and generate videos and images in their original sizes. The paper deconstructs Sora's architecture to understand how it surmounts challenges posed by videos of varying durations, resolutions, and aspect ratios. Sora employs a latent space video compression network combined with spatial patch compression and a diffusion transformer workflow to produce videos in diverse formats.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The Sora model has profound implications across multiple areas such as improving simulation abilities, boosting creativity, driving educational innovations, enhancing accessibility, and fostering emerging applications. The paper also points to the limitations and potential areas for improvement, such as the expression of complex actions and emotional nuances, as well as the critical importance of avoiding biases and harmful content in generated visuals.

#### Summary
This review article provides an insight into Soraâ€”a large vision model, discussing its technological features, innovative aspects, current limitations, and potential opportunities for future applications. Sora's capabilities signify progressive strides made by large vision models, including long video generation and processing of diverse video formats.
