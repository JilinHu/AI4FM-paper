#### Background
- **Background**
Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the NLP field, offering significant potential for user modeling and personalized applications. However, harnessing complex user interaction data effectively for LLMs is still a challenge due to the intricate nature and potential noise within the data.

- **Existing Work**
Existing user models and recommendation systems, such as dual encoders and self-supervised learning, provide multifaceted and multimodal user interaction data. They help create transferable representations for user understanding and personalization but are still constrained by complex, multimodal, and sparse interaction types.

#### Core Contributions
  - **A new framework called USER-LLM**
    - **Challenge 1: Complexity and noise in multimodal interaction data**
      USER-LLM tackles the issue of user data complexity and noise by generating user embeddings through self-supervised training, which encapsulates user preferences and their changes over time.

    - **Challenge 2: Limitations of computational resources**
      Due to the high computational cost of traditional LLMs processing long sequences of user behavior data, USER-LLM employs cross-attention and soft-prompting to amalgamate concise user embeddings with LLMs, reducing the computational demands for processing extensive historical interactions.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The experimental results on the MovieLens, Amazon Review, and Google Local Review datasets indicate that USER-LLM outperforms traditional text-prompt-based contextualization in tasks requiring an in-depth understanding of users and handling of long sequences, while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework supports different encoder architectures and multimodal fusion mechanisms, displaying potential in various application areas including user understanding, personalized recommendations, and text generation. Furthermore, the use of Perceiver layers streamlines the integration between user encoders and LLMs, enhancing computational efficiency. Flexible training strategies of USER-LLM, such as fine-tuning the user encoder while keeping the LLM frozen, have proven effective in contextualizing the LLM, surpassing LoRA-based text-prompt LLM tuning while preserving the original LLM weights.

#### Summary
USER-LLM is a framework that contextualizes LLMs using user embeddings. It addresses the complexities of user data and the challenges of processing long sequences, improving the usability of LLMs in personalized applications while being computationally efficient.
