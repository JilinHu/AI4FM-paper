#### Background
- **Background**
The paper discusses the challenges of developing multi-agent systems in the context of the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike single-agent systems, multi-agent systems require collaborative efforts from multiple agents. Despite significant progress in multi-agent applications within both Research and industrial communities, there remain significant challenges in developing robust and efficient multi-agent applications.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research indicates that developing multi-agent applications is more complex than single-agent configurations as it involves the careful creation and management of multiple models and agents. Additionally, despite rapid advancements, large language models still struggle with hallucination phenomena and insufficient instruction-following, and multi-agent systems may introduce more uncertainties, such as database or internet access capabilities. Therefore, ensuring that the system autonomously detects and handles incorrect responses when errors occur is crucial, as well as supporting multimodal data and distributed applications, which places high demands on the development platform.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced AgentScope, a Multi-Agent Platform**
    - **Challenge 1: Balancing Usability and Versatility**
        AgentScope emphasizes usability, especially for developers of varying experience levels, by implementing a procedure-oriented message exchange mechanism for a smoother learning curve. Additionally, AgentScope offers an extensive suite of syntactic tools, abundant built-in resources, and integrated user interaction modules, facilitating more enjoyable multi-agent application programming.

    - **Challenge 2: Designing Fault-tolerance Mechanisms**
        AgentScope integrates a comprehensive service-level retry mechanism to ensure API reliability and is equipped with rule-based correction tools to handle obvious formatting problems in LLM responses. It also provides customizable fault-tolerance configurations, allowing developers to tailor their own mechanisms using parameters such as parse_func, fault_handler, and max_retries. Furthermore, AgentScope proposes a logging system with features customized for multi-agent applications as the ultimate safeguard.

    - **Additional Contribution Points**
        AgentScope supports the use of multimodal data (e.g., files, images, audio, videos) in dialogue presentation, message transmission, and data storage. Additionally, the platform introduces an actor-based distributed mechanism ensuring that workflows remain consistent between local and distributed deployments, thus minimizing overhead when migrating applications, and allowing developers to focus more on application design rather than implementation details.

#### Implementation and Deployment
As a multi-agent platform, AgentScope highlighted user-friendly communication mechanisms, abundant development resources, and support for efficient operations in distributed environments. While there are no direct evaluation results or comparisons with other works provided in the paper, AgentScope's design features underline its ease of development, testing, and deployment, encouraging broader participation and innovation.

#### Summary
AgentScope is a versatile platform for building multi-agent applications, emphasizing usability and customizability, particularly catered to developers with varying skill levels. By implementing fault tolerance and supporting multimodal data processing, as well as optimizing distributed operations, AgentScope significantly reduces the complexity of developing and deploying multi-agent systems, promoting wider participation and innovation.
