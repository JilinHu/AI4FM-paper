#### Background
- **Background**
The research concerns enhancing realism and expressiveness in the generation of talking head videos, focusing on the dynamic interaction between audio cues and facial movements. The paper identifies the conventional methods' failure to capture the complete spectrum of human expressions and the uniqueness of individual facial styles.

- **Existing Work**
Existing approaches often cannot capture the full range of human expressions and individual facial uniqueness. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes EMO, a novel framework that bypasses the necessity for intermediate 3D models or facial landmarks through a direct audio-to-video synthesis approach.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introducing an expressive audio-driven portrait video generation framework (EMO)**
  - **Challenge 1: Enhancing realism and expressiveness**
    EMO bypasses intermediate representations and directly maps audio to video, which allows the generation of highly expressive and lifelike animations with seamless frame transitions and consistent identity. EMO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods significantly, producing videos with considerable expressiveness and realism.
  
  - **Challenge 2: Building a diverse dataset for model training**
    For model training, a vast and diverse audio-video dataset was constructed, including over 250 hours of footage and more than 150 million images. This comprehensive dataset encompasses content ranging from speeches to film and TV excerpts, and even singing performances in multiple languages such as Chinese and English, thus providing a solid foundation for developing EMO.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Extensive experiments and comparisons conducted on the HDTF dataset verified the superiority of the method, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods like DreamTalk, Wav2Lip, and SadTalker on various benchmarks including FID, SyncNet, F-SIM, and FVD. In addition to quantitative evaluations, comprehensive user studies and qualitative assessments revealed the method's capability to generate highly natural and expressive talking and singing videos, achieving the best results to date.

#### Summary
The EMO framework enhances the realism and expressiveness of generated videos through a direct audio-to-video synthesis method, significantly surpassing existing technologies and marking a significant advance in the field of video synthesis.
