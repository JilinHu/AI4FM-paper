#### Background
- **Background**
This paper discusses the significant impact that the order of premises has on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks, even when the order does not alter the task itself. An extensive evaluation demonstrated that LLMs tend to mimic human preferences regarding the order of premises, achieving the best performance when the order follows intermediate reasoning steps necessary to solve the problem. Conversely, the performance of LLMs drops by over 30% when the problem requires the model to read the description back-and-forth. Additionally, the study was expanded into mathematical reasoning, and the R-GSM benchmark was introduced, confirming the impact of premise ordering experimentally.

- **Existing Work**
Current work has not fully explored how the performance of LLMs changes with adjustments in the order of premises and how such changes significantly affect the models' reasoning capabilities.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a comprehensive evaluation**
      - **Challenge 1: Impact of premise order on LLM performance**
        The challenge lies in the significant impact of premise order on LLM reasoning performance without changing the substantive task. Researchers showed that, like humans, LLMs prefer a "forward" (in line with problem-solving steps) order of premises, and performance declines when models need to read the problem description repeatedly.

      - **Challenge 2: Adapting to different types of reasoning tasks**
        The second challenge was to examine the impact of premise order in different types of reasoning tasks (like logical and mathematical reasoning). By creating new R-GSM benchmark tests and conducting thorough evaluations, researchers confirmed the effect of premise ordering adjustments in different reasoning tasks.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The researchers introduced the R-GSM benchmark comprising 220 problems and evaluated the performance of LLMs thoroughly. For instance, showing accuracy comparisons for different premise order configurations, including "forward," "backward," and "shuffled," under the condition of 5 or 10 distracting rules, these results fundamentally displayed how LLMs differed significantly in performance under different orders of premises, especially when the order contradicted the natural sequence of solving steps, leading to decreased accuracy.

#### Summary
The paper focuses on the influence that the order of premises has on LLMs when conducting reasoning tasks, and the impact was assessed via the newly created R-GSM benchmark test. It reveals the extreme sensitivity of LLMs to premise ordering, showing a substantial effect on performance.
