#### Background
- **Background**       
This paper discusses the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the revolution of artificial intelligence and their remarkable proficiency in diverse tasks. LLMs are particularly adept at self-evaluation and enhancement, depending on their critical reasoning capabilities, including critiquing—identifying issues in given responses, and correcting—proposing appropriate changes.

- **Existing Work**
Existing studies have concentrated on LLMs' critique and rectification abilities but have been limited to a narrow set of models and datasets, leading to inconsistent findings. This emphasizes the urgent need for a systematized assessment of LLMs' critique and correction capacities.

#### Core Contributions
  - **CRITICBENCH: A Comprehensive Benchmark**
    - **Challenge 1: Systematic Assessment of LLMs' Critique and Correction Reasoning Abilities**
      CRITICBENCH includes 15 datasets across five reasoning domains intended to thoroughly assess LLMs' critique and correction reasoning capacities across various tasks. Using CRITICBENCH, researchers investigated the impact of base models, training strategies, prompt strategies, and oracle feedback on the critique-correct reasoning performance of LLMs.

    - **Challenge 2: Unveiling Key Factors Affecting LLMs' Critical Reasoning**
      Evaluated performance of 17 LLMs on CRITICBENCH reveals: (1) a linear relationship in generative, critique, and correction (GQC) capabilities, with critique-focused training significantly boosting performance; (2) task type significantly affects critique and correction effectiveness, with logic-oriented tasks being more amenable to correction; (3) inconsistencies in GQC knowledge decrease as the model size increases; (4) an interesting inter-model critiquing pattern where stronger models are better at critiquing, yet weaker models can sometimes surpass stronger ones in self-critique.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The research employed responses created by eight models from the LLaMA, Vicuna, and GPT series to conduct extensive experiments on 17 LLMs, including closed-source models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and open-source models such as Phi-2, the LLaMa family, Vicuna family, and the Mistral family. Experiments showcased model performance on CRITICBENCH and disclosed characteristics of performance differences among models on various task types and the consistency of critique-correct knowledge.

#### Summary
The paper evaluates LLMs' critique and correction reasoning abilities through CRITICBENCH, exploring key factors influencing these competencies, aiming to foster further research in LLM critique and self-improvement.
