#### Background
- **Background**       
The paper discusses systematic studies on the effects of data size, model size, and choice of finetuning methods on the finetuning process of large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the interaction among these factors.

- **Existing Work**
Existing research has not fully explored how these factors impact outcomes under different finetuning settings, and the interplay of these variables is rarely considered in conventional finetuning processes.

#### Core Contributions
- **Systematic analysis of the effects of data size, model size, and finetuning methods**
    - **Challenge 1: How to systematically study the complex interplay between data size, model size, and finetuning method on LLM performance?**
        The paper presents, for the first time, a framework that analyzes the impact of these factors in unison, utilizing extensive experimental data to validate the influence of various amounts of data on performance across different finetuning methods and model sizes.

    - **Challenge 2: How to identify the best finetuning methods?**
        The paper explores three distinct finetuning strategies: Full-Model Tuning (FMT), Prompt Tuning (Prompt), and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Each method is specially designed for parameter optimization during the finetuning process and is compared in detail to gauge the effectiveness of different methods under various conditions.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper mainly studies three finetuning methods: Full-Model Tuning (FMT), Prompt Tuning (Prompt), and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), with experiments involving varying sizes of training data, different scales of LLM models, and various finetuning settings. Evaluation is based on token-level perplexity (PPL) on the development set, while scaling laws are reported on test sets; for general generation tasks, greedy decoding is used, and BLEURT and RougeL metrics are employed for translation and summarization tasks. Zero-shot evaluation also included using the Flores200 dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that the scaling effect generally follows a power-law relationship when incorporating different factors, and the specific initial conditions for finetuning methods significantly impact model performance.

#### Summary
The paper provides significant insights into the impact of factors such as data size, model size, and finetuning methods on the performance of LLMs during the finetuning phase, defining a new framework for evaluation.
