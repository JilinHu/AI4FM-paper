#### Background
- **Background**
The paper describes the development process of BigCode's The Stack v2 and StarCoder2. Managed by ServiceNow and Hugging Face, BigCode is an open scientific collaboration focusing on the open and responsible development of Code LLMs.

- **Existing Work**
Unlike other projects that have not disclosed their training data, BigCode offers a completely open development path, including the release of training data, training frameworks, and assessment toolsets.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced a new training dataset and two generations of StarCoder models**
      - **Challenge 1: Quality and diversity of the dataset**
      The dataset includes sources such as over 600 programming languages' source codes, GitHub issues, pull requests, Kaggle, and Jupyter notebooks; the paper emphasizes the importance of establishing high-quality open data sources and prepares the data through deduplication, filtering low-quality code, redacting PII, and removing malicious code, ensuring the quality of the training set.

      - **Challenge 2: Designing an effective training process**
      Despite existing recommendations on the optimal number of training tokens (Chinchilla, a.k.a. Harmâ€™s law), the project pushed a significant amount of training tokens through Code LLMs with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters and implemented a two-stage training process, training relatively small models in the range of 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Performance of the models was assessed across a suite of code LLM benchmarks, finding that the various StarCoder2 models (3B, 7B, 15B parameters) performed exceedingly well in the majority of the tests, particularly the 15B parameter model, which outperformed other similar scale models in low-resource programming languages and reasoning-required benchmarks. This signifies the efficacy of the utilized training set and training process in enhancing model quality. Additionally, this performance assessment lets this technical report's study be compared with other works in the field, proving its advantages over the alternatives.

#### Summary
The paper presented the development process of The Stack v2 and StarCoder2, a work focused on large-scale pre-training and instruction fine-tuning for code. Researchers significantly enhanced the performance of code LLMs, especially in handling low-resource programming languages and tasks requiring code reasoning, by integrating diverse data sources and a meticulously designed training process.
