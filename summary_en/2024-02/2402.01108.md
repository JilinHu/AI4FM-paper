#### Background
- **Background**
Recent advancements in LLMs have shown immense potential for multi-agent systems in enterprise platforms. However, they face constraints like budgets, resources, and time when deployed in real-world scenarios.
  
- **Existing Work**
Current multi-agent system approaches focus on narrow objectives for optimization and evaluation, which do not consider the real-world constraints, making it difficult to interpret, analyze, and debug the systems.

#### Core Contributions
  - **Introduced the concept of reasoning capacity**
  
    - **Challenge 1: Integrating constraints during optimization and connecting different components within the system for evaluation.**
      Reasoning capacity serves as a unifying criterion to address this challenge, allowing for more holistic and comprehensive evaluation.
  
    - **Challenge 2: Improving optimization, monitoring, debugging, and evaluation in multi-agent systems.**
      Defining reasoning capacity helps identify limitations within components and uses a self-reflective process with human feedback to address shortcomings in reasoning, enhancing system consistency.

#### Implementation and Deployment
The paper formalizes the definition of reasoning capacity and demonstrates its utility in identifying limitations within system components. It discusses the detection and resolution of existing limitations and constraints through reasoning capacity (RC) and suggests potential research directions for practical applications of multi-agent systems. The paper argues for integrating human reasoning into multi-agent systems to alleviate reasoning bottlenecks and proposes self-reflection with human feedback to enhance reasoning capabilities.

#### Summary
This paper introduces the concept of reasoning capacity in multi-agent systems to improve optimization and evaluation and explores the potential of human feedback to enhance system reasoning capabilities.
