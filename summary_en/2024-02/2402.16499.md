#### Background
- **Background**
The paper addresses the challenge of assessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dynamic multi-agent environments. Multi-agent environments typically require specific capabilities from agents, such as spatial reasoning, opponent modeling, and team collaboration, which are critical for effective agent behavior.
- **Existing Work**
Existing evaluation methods are often limited to evaluating single agents and fail to fully capture the characteristics of large language models in game or cooperative scenarios and have not ventured into evaluations within multimodal dynamic environments.

#### Core Contributions
- **Introduced LLMARENA, a benchmark tool.**
    - **Challenge 1: Assessing the capabilities of LLMs in dynamic multi-agent environments.**
        The challenge is how to quantify and evaluate the performance of LLMs across various capabilities in multi-agent settings. LLMARENA, through in-depth analysis in 7 game environments, reveals the shortcomings of LLMs in spatial reasoning, opponent modeling, and team collaboration. This benchmark provides a new platform to measure and motivate future research in assessing the multidimensional abilities of LLMs.

    - **Challenge 2: Advancing the performance of LLM agents in dynamic multi-agent settings.**
        The study states that improving LLM agents' performance in dynamic multi-agent settings remains an unresolved challenge, with LLMARENA offering a tool for evaluation to stimulate future research progress in this area.

#### Implementation and Deployment
Based on the evaluation results, LLMs with different configurations exhibited variable performance across 7 environments, showcasing a notable improvement in abilities as the scale of model parameters increased. Yet even with numerous parameters, models like GPT-4 displayed distinct behaviors, indicating the models' markedly different performance in certain scenarios.

#### Summary
The study introduced the LLMARENA benchmark to assess the capabilities of LLM agents in complex multi-agent settings, highlighting existing issues and advancing future research directions, including capabilities in multimodal dynamic contexts and the potential use of external tools.
